Whispering to flowers When the snow and ice just started to melt, the stream is already full of flowers. At this time, I like to come to the creek with a small flower basket. Smell the flower, smell the flower, and I whisper to the flowers. Hello, Camellia! You said, your little face, was frozen red on that frosting night? Or did you wake up early to greet the sun, and Xia Xia kissed you, were you shy? Camellia, do nâ€™t just laugh, you tell me your secret! Hello, azalea! Hello, smiling flowers! What is your happy event? Why are you so happy? Yo, you have sent a fragrant and colorful invitation letter. Your guests, bees and butterflies, are coming. No wonder you are so busy, no wonder you are so happy! Tell me, the flowers of Wanhuaxi, why do you have so many colors? Blue, red, yellow, white, purple ... You have dressed up a stream with fragrance, and you put a lace on our village. See, you laugh back and forth, how happy you are. You like a variety of colors, you like to have a variety of flowers. Yo, flowers, tell me, are you children of Mother Earth? Just like our little doll, it is mother's child, mother's flower. I think you must be children of Mother Earth. Only Mother Earth has so many, so beautiful children!
