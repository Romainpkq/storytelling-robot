Big shoes swing A baby elephant is wearing four big shoes. Run and run. One of the shoes has a hole in it. The remaining three were useless, and "thump flutter" was thrown into the grass. Doodle bears, furry balls, and mouses play ball together on the grass. The ball rolled and rolled into the grass. The Baotou went to find it, but it was not found; the Maomao ball went to find it, but it was not found; the Dudu bear went to find it, but it was not found. They found three big round shoes in the grass. Whose shoes are these? So big and so round, there are three more. "Whose shoes? Whose shoes?" They shouted for a long time and no one agreed, it must be no one wanted. The Baotou put four small wheels under one shoe and made a small car. It was really comfortable to sit on it. Mao Maoqiu tied two straps to the shoes to make a small swing. It was really fun to go around. What does the doodle bear do with big shoes? Use it to make a flower pot and plant the most beautiful flower. The baby elephant also came to play, and saw the bunny-wheeled mouse, the small swing of the furry ball, and the flower of the doodle bear, and opened his eyes in surprise: "I didn't expect that my shoes could be made so much fun Something. "Baby elephants also came to play, and saw the bunny-wheeled wheelbarrow, the small swing of the fur ball, and the flowers of the bear, and opened their eyes in surprise:" I did not expect that my shoes could be made So many fun things.
