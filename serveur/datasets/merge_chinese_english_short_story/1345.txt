Why don't bats go to the meeting? In the big forest, there are all kinds of birds. They choose the peacock as the bird king. Bats also live in this forest. Once the bat had just returned to the cave and was preparing to sleep, the peacock came. It said happily: "Bat, tomorrow we will have a bird meeting, you will come too!" "Me?" Bat said with a smile, "How can I attend your bird convention? I am a beast!" "You are Beast? The beasts I saw were all crawling on the ground. You have wings and can fly in the sky, are n’t they like us? ”The peacock was angry, and the bat hurriedly explained,“ My wings are different from yours .Look, there are no feathers on it! "The bat opened its wings to show the peacock. Really, its wings are just a thin layer of skin, with hands and feet attached to it, and its wings are light, without a feather. Suddenly "squeaked" for a while, the peacock took a closer look. It turned out that the little bat was crying. It was lying in the arms of her mother and was breastfeeding! The peacock is very strange. The bat said, "Look, this is where we are different from you! My children were born as little bats. They all grew up eating my milk. Your birds are all eggs and hatched birds. Besides We still have teeth, and you don't have them! "" Oh! I'm wrong, sorry! "Peacock said, flapping his wings and flying back. Really, its wings are just a thin layer of skin, with hands and feet attached to it, and its wings are light, without a feather.
