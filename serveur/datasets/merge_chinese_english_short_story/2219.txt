Where is spring? Find spring in nature! Spring is on the branches, the wicker is green, and the peach blossoms are bright. Spring is in the air, and the wind is warm, and the swallows fly. Spring is in the water, fish chasing, ducks playing in the water. Spring is in the field, the young wheat is green, and the cauliflower is golden. Spring is everywhere, and spring is full of people!
