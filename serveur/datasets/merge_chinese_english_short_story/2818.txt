Seeing the animals knowing the weather The changing weather directly affects the lives of animals. Some small animals can feel the weather changes and be prepared in advance. The ants moved and the heavy rain blew. Before the heavy rain, as the humidity in the air increased, the water absorbed by the soil increased greatly, so the ant nests built in the soil became humid. In order to avoid flooding, ants often move before heavy rain. The bees came out of the nest and the weather was fine. After a long rain turned clear, the air pressure began to rise, the humidity in the air gradually decreased, pollen appeared on the stamens of the plants, and the bees went out to collect nectar. In order to avoid flooding, ants often move before heavy rain.
