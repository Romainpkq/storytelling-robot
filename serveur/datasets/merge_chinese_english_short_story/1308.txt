What is the New Year I had a dream, I was on a spaceship to travel. I asked the stars: "What is New Year?" The stars whispered, "New Year is new clothes and hats." Moon said aloud, "New Year is candy and toys." The sun smiled and said, "New Year is happy, New Year is progress. "I see. New year is here, and I'm one year older. I will be more sensible and capable! "The stars whispered," The new year is new clothes and hats.
