Just after it rained, the sun came out and a rainbow of seven colors appeared in the sky. People praised the rainbow. When Hong heard this, she became proud and said that she was more beautiful than the sun. The sun said to Hong, "You are beautiful, this is true. But without me, you are not." Hong didn't believe it, but she was even more proud. The sun shook its head and hid in the clouds, and the rainbow disappeared immediately. When Hong heard this, she became proud and said that she was more beautiful than the sun.
