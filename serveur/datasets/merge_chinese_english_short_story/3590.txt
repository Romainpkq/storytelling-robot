"Eye" and "Sunny" one day, the careless little monkey opened the workbook and found several "×" s on the notebook. It turned out that he wrote "eye" as "Qing". The little monkey is very sad, but he has no way to distinguish the two words. At this time, the word "clear" said to the little monkey: "Brother Monkey, I am sunny, and there must be a sun on a sunny day, so I am next to the word" Sun "." "Eye" interjected and said, "Brother Monkey, I also It ’s easy to remember, who has two eyes, are n’t the two horizontal lines in my "eyes" like two eyes? "The little monkey listened to them and smiled happily.
