Watching the lantern festival One day in September, night fell and had a good dinner. I followed my dad to the stadium to watch the lantern festival in excitement. Entering the door, looking at the past, the crowds of people, the entire stadium is like a sea of ​​lights, colorful, surrounded by daylight, golden and brilliant, so magnificent! I followed in the footsteps of my father and visited a variety of delicate palace lanterns, marquee lanterns, and crystal elephant lanterns. The more I look the more excited and the more I am curious. What I particularly like is the "peacock lamp". The feathers on the screen of the peacock are like gems with colorful colors. The mouths of the "Dragon Lanterns" were closed one by one and spit out a string of pearls, as if living. I think: If the lamp is compared to the stars in the sky, the stars are not as colorful as it is; if the lamp is compared to the flowers on the ground, the flowers are not as dazzling as it is. At the end of the visit, my dad asked me, "What are these lights made of?" I took a closer look at it. It turns out that these lights are made of small bottles, pots, bamboos, etc. I really admire the production of these lights The designers of the lights, how clever and smart they are, how wonderful a bright world they make up with these gadgets!
