There is a beautiful lake in my hometown called Swan Lake. It is said that many years ago, a group of swans lived here, hence the name. The lake has a circular shape, the water of the lake is clear, and the green is shiny. The lake is surrounded by dense trees. One of the most striking is the weeping willow. Under the breeze, the wicker danced against the wind. You can see that the figure of the girl Liu is very beautiful. Under the tree was a piece of tender green grass with yellow and blue flowers on it. There is a beautiful small bridge on the lake, which makes Swan Lake even more beautiful. Oh, Swan Lake, the lake in my hometown, I love you! There is a beautiful lake in my hometown called Swan Lake.
