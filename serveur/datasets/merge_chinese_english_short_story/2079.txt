In the doctor's forest of trees, there is a hundred-year-old tree, which grows leafy and is a good place for birds to play. One day, for some reason, the leaves of the old tree slowly turned yellow. The branches began to wither. The little birds were very anxious and hurried to see the woodpecker doctor. The woodpecker doctor flew over. He stopped on a branch and knocked with his mouth first. Oh ! It turned out that the tree worm was messing up. The woodpecker took out its "scalpel"-a sharp mouth pecked, pecked, and pecked the old tree, pecked out a small mouth, and then extended his mouth in to forcefully hook the tree worm out. After a while, the tree worms on the old tree were completely eaten by the woodpecker. Wow ! So comfortable. The old tree opened a smile and said, "Thank you, Doctor Woodpecker." The woodpecker said, "No thanks, this is what I should do." The birds can play on the old tree again. The woodpecker took out its "scalpel"-a sharp mouth pecked, pecked, and pecked the old tree, pecked out a small mouth, and then extended his mouth in to forcefully hook the tree worm out.
