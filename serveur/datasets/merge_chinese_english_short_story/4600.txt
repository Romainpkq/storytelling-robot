Changing hands Silk flower expert Every morning, when the music of sunshine sports sounds, the students of every class will rush to the school playground in a hurry. When you pass a small playground, you will always see a blooming flower dancing in the breeze. Who is under this flower? She is Xu Zhuomin in our class. Xu Zhuomin's silk flowers are very powerful. I call her a little expert at changing hands and silk flowers. Not only will she turn her left hand, but she will also hold it up, even if she does not make a mistake even if she does it twice. She is indeed a little expert in silk flowers in my mind.
