When the seasons song arrives in spring, the magpie cries, and the peach blossoms are so lively. When summer arrives, I know it, and the lotus smiles. When autumn comes, the geese call, the sweet-scented osmanthus chrysanthemum fragrance. When winter comes, the north wind cries, and the red plum is pretty in the snow.
