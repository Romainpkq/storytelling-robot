Dog and its shadow A dog crosses a small river over a wooden bridge with a piece of meat in its mouth. When he saw the river reflecting its reflection, he thought that another dog was holding a piece of meat, and he threw it away, and rushed to grab the dog's flesh. In fact, that piece of meat did not exist at all, but its own meat made the river run away. It turned out to be nothing.
