Grandpa Dong 's gift is gray. Grandpa Dong came to the world with naughty and cute snowflakes. The glittering little snowflakes are blooming all over the sky, and the white little flowers are floating! Little snowflakes put a white coat on spruce, and the spruce is warm; small snowflakes cover a wheat field with a white quilt, and wheat seedlings are warm. The naughty north wind came whistling and wanted to blow off the snow coat and run away the snow quilt. The north wind went to blow on the snow coat, but it sounded a series of pleasant bells. Alas, did Xiaoxue hang the bell on the spruce? Oh no, no, it was the spruce snow coat that had a layer of ice flowers, and the wind blew, Ding Ling, Ding Ling ... The north wind went to blow the snow coat, but it sounded a string of pleasant bells.
