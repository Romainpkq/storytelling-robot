My puppy must write about our puppy first. It is called "Prince". It is the most flowery and most beautiful dog in our village. It is like a naughty boy. It runs especially fast, and I can't keep up with it. But the "prince" is very good, it is always waiting for me. The "prince" would laugh, but I never saw it cry. I taught it to recognize words, but it did nâ€™t even learn a single letter, but it did love class. When I taught it to read the word "dog", it called the most joyful. It must be thinking, this is who it is! The "prince" will still count, but in total he will count to two. It also specializes in humming and barking. "What are you doing?" I asked it as it hummed in front of me. "Prince" "Wang"! With a cry, shook his head and said he wanted to go out. "What else do I want to do now" When we walked out of the yard, I then asked it. "The prince" cried again and ran towards the railway. "You should finish talking once!" I was running anxiously while following it, because I wanted to go there too. I even know what the "prince" wants to do there. It likes to run with the train. Every time it loses, it never cares. Whenever a new train comes, the "prince" thinks he can beat it. When it stopped running, it barked a few times. I don't know if it allowed the train to go, or I scolded the train for a meal. I can't tell the difference.
