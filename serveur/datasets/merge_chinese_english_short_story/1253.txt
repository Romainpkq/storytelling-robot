Her face was flushed, and she said happily to her father, "Winter is fun, I wish it would always be winter!" My father said, "Write down your wishes!" Mi Jia wrote down her first wish. Here comes spring, Mi Jia is chasing colorful butterflies on the green grass. She cheerfully said to her father, "Spring is so beautiful, I hope it will always be spring!" The father took out a small book and let Mi Jia write down a second wish. It is summer . Mi Jia and his father went to the suburbs, catching small fish, picking mushrooms, and turning their heads in the shade, they had a great time. She said to her father with satisfaction: "Summer is great, I wish that summer would never pass!" Mi Jia wrote this wish in a small book again. In autumn, there were many fruits in the orchard. Mi Jia helped his father to pick off the red apples, and helped grandma to carry a basket of grapes home. She excitedly said to her father, "Autumn is better than any season!" My father took out a small book and showed it to Mi Jia. Winter, spring, and summer, she said the same. Her face was flushed, and she said happily to her father, "Winter is so interesting. I wish it would always be winter!
