Little Fox 's Necklace Little Fox and Mom and Dad planted many broad beans last fall. In spring, fava beans bloomed beautiful pansies, bearing many large and full fava beans. They harvested many broad beans. The mother fox strung the broad beans and made a green necklace, which was hung around the little fox's neck. The little fox wore a green necklace and looked in the mirror. It was so beautiful! She went out happily to find a friend to play with. On the way, the little fox met a little flower dog, and the little dog is lying on the ground looking for something! The little fox asked strangely: "Little flower dog, what are you looking for?" The little flower dog said sadly: "My button was lost." At first glance, the little flower dog was missing a green button. The little fox immediately took a broad bean and handed it to the little dog: "Is this button beautiful?" The little dog said happily, "Thank you, little fox!" "Meow" yelled fiercely, and she hurried over to see. It turned out that tomorrow is the birthday of the good friend Bunny. The little cat is preparing a picture for the bunny. There are green leaves and red flowers on the picture, but some fruits are missing. The little cat is not able to draw the fruits and is anxious to call. The little fox saw it, and immediately took off the necklace and handed it to the little cat, saying, "Just hang these fruits on it!" Everyone hung the broad beans on the leaves and flowers, haha! This picture is so beautiful! Everyone happily danced around the picture. It was getting dark, and the little fox jumped back home. What happened to the little fox mother? Where did the little fox 's necklace go? Where did the little fox 's necklace go?
