A whisper to the flowers When the snow and ice began to melt, the stream was full of flowers. At this time, I like to carry a small flower basket and come to the stream. Smell this flower, smell that flower, and I whisper to the flowers. Hello, camellia! You say, is your little face frozen in that frosty night? Or do you get up early to meet the sun, and morning glow kisses you, are you shy? Camellia, don't just laugh, tell me your secret! Hi Azalea! Hello, smiley flower! What joy do you have? Why are you so cheerful? Yo, you have already sent out a fragrant and colorful invitation letter. Your guests, bees and butterflies, are coming. No wonder you are so busy, no wonder you are so cheerful! Tell me, why do you have so many colors in the flowers of Wanhuaxi? Blue, red, yellow, white, purple ... you have dressed up a stream of colorful fragrance, and you have laced our village. See, how happy you are when you laugh back and forth. You like a wide variety of colors, and you like a wide variety of flowers. O flowers, tell me, are you sons and daughters of Mother Earth? Just like our little baby, is a mother's child, mother's flower. I think you must be children of Mother Earth. Only earth mothers have so many and such beautiful children! O flowers, tell me, are you sons and daughters of Mother Earth?
