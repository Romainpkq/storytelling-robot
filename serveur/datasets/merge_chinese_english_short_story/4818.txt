Why do we need to paint the trunk with lime water? We often see the lower half of some trees in the park, in the orchard and on both sides of the road painted white. This white substance is lime water. The role of this white coating is really quite a lot! First of all, lime water of this concentration can not only eliminate diseases and insect pests, but also kill all kinds of overwintering insect eggs. Secondly, this white coating can prevent frostbite of trees. Because the temperature difference between day and night in the northern region is large, especially in early spring before winter. The trunk is very easy to swell and crack when frozen. The white coating can reflect part of the sunlight and heat energy, so that the temperature of the trunk does not change much, reducing the impact of the temperature difference on the trees. Again, the trunk is painted white, which not only beautifies the environment, but also prevents livestock from eating the trees and protects the normal growth of the trees.
