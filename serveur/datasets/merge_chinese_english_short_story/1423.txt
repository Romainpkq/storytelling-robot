One day, the two husbands had a cousin eating noodles and a grandpa drinking tea. The little cousin asked, "Grandpa, why is your beard so long? Why am I without a beard?" Dad smiled and said, "You are not old yet!" The little cousin thought for a while, and put some noodles in it On his lips, he said to his grandpa, "Grandpa, look, I'm old and I have a beard." Grandpa said with a smile to his little cousin, "We have two husbands here." The little cousin thought. When I thought about it, I put some noodles on my lips and said to my grandpa, "Grandpa, look, I'm old and I have a beard.
