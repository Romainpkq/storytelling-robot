The precious friendship rooster lives with the sister of the rabbit, the sister of the duck, and the brother of the squirrel. One morning, the rabbit sister came to find the younger brother of the rooster: "I'm going to buy carrots, lend me a basket." The cock said: "I want to use it myself, don't borrow!" At noon, the duck sister came to find the brother of the rooster: "You help me Untie the bow! "Said the rooster:" I want to eat, not free! "At night, the squirrel brother came to the rooster brother:" Tomorrow morning I will go up the mountain to cut wood, you call me! "Rooster said:" I have no energy , Don't call! "Late night, the strong wind lifted the roof of the rooster's house. The rooster cried and jumped anxiously. Rabbits, ducks and squirrels came to help the rooster repair the roof. It was repaired in a while, and the cock blushed. With the help of the little animals, the rooster repaired the roof that was lifted by the strong wind. It can be seen how precious the friendship is! Let us all learn to care for others and be a good child who helps others!
