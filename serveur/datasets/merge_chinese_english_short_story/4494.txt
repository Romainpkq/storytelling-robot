Happy tree spring is a good season for planting trees. I carried the shovel, took the sapling, and came to the river. I dug a hole with a spade and carefully planted the saplings. My mother saw me and asked me with a smile: "My child, what kind of tree do you plant?" I answered loudly: "When I grow up, this happy tree will grow up. I hope this tree will be sent to children around the world Spread happiness. "Mom touched my head and said kindly:" We wish the happiness tree grow up quickly so that every child in the world can share happiness! "
