The colorful greeting card forest sent me a green greeting card, which is a green leaf. The forest wishes me to thrive like a sapling, and every leaf is a song of joy ... The blue sky gave me a white greeting card, that is a piece of white cloud. The blue sky calls me to use Baiyun as a wing, into a flying white dove ... the sea gives me a blue greeting card, it is a blue shell. The sea asked me to turn the shell into a small boat, face the wind and waves, and harvest the treasure ... The sun gave me a red greeting card, which was the glow of red glow. The sun wants me to grow up in the sun and dedicate wisdom to our dear motherland!
