The beautiful bear polluted the bear and planted a lot of flowers. The yard smelled fragrant. The puppy wanted to buy a pot, but the bear said, "My flowers are not for sale, I just give them away. Come to pick flowers on June 5!" On the 5th, the bear carried a pot of potted flowers onto a tricycle, and the wooden sign "Recycle used batteries and give you a pot of flowers" was inserted on it. The puppies understand that today is World Environment Day, and the bears are protecting the environment, and I want to participate. Jingle bells, tricycles crossing alleys, crossing the street, the puppy ran and shouted: "beautiful for pollution, flowers for waste batteries!" When the kittens and rabbits heard it, they went out, put down the waste batteries, and took away a pot of flowers. When Huge Monkey arrived with a basket of used batteries, the flowers had already been delivered. Huge Monkey said with a smile: "It doesn't matter. To care for the environment is to protect our lives." When the delivery was over, Huge Monkey said with a smile: "It's okay. Taking care of the environment means taking care of our lives.
