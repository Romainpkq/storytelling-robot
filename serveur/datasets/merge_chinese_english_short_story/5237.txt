A horse lost its way in the desert. In the evening, the pony was tired from walking, and he thought: If there is a sip of water, how good it is! At this moment, it saw not far away, a few bright flowers on the stone. The pony curled up a flower with his tongue. How sweet is this flower! "This is good!" The pony cried with joy and ate all the flowers. The next day, Pony finally returned to his mother. The pony told her story to her mother and told her that it was because she ate flowers on the stone and came back with strength. The mother said with a smile: "Child, that's not stone, it's a kind of plant called lithoflower." "It turns out that way!" Pony understood.
