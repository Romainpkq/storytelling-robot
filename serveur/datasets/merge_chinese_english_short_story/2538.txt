One day with "eyes" and "clear", the careless little monkey opened the workbook and found that there were several "×" on the book. It turned out that he wrote "eyes" as "clear". The little monkey was very sad, but he couldn't distinguish the two words. At this time, the word "qing" said to the little monkey: "Brother monkey, I am sunny on a sunny day, there must be a sun on a sunny day, so I am next to the word" ri. " It ’s easy to remember, who has two eyes, are n’t the two eyes in my 'eye' like two eyes? ”The little monkey smiled happily after listening to their words. "Eyes" chimed in and said, "Brother Monkey, I have to remember. Everyone has two eyes. Do the two lines in my" eyes "look like two eyes?
