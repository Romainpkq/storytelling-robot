Treasure It will never be known as Mother 's Day until I am a child forever. I remember when I was in the kindergarten class, the teacher told us that Mother's Day is a holiday for the children to express their gratitude to the mother. Thanks to the mother for giving me, raising me, and raising me. At that time, the teacher taught us to cut a "heart" with red paper and write my name on it to give it to my mother. That day, my mother came back from abroad. I went to the airport to meet her with my father. When I saw my mother, I was embarrassed to take out the presents; my father reminded me that I gave my "heart" to my mother. I said to my mother, "Mom, Happy Mother's Day!" My mother picked me up and kissed me twice. There seemed to be a tear in her eyes. Mom puts the "heart" in her box and keeps it till now, no matter where she goes, this "heart" is always with her. I deeply feel: My little thoughts bring happiness to my mother and let her treasure it forever. Mom puts the "heart" in her box and keeps it till now, no matter where she goes, this "heart" is always with her.
