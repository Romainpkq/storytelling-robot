Azalea Sunday, I went for a walk in the park. I strolled to the flowerbed, which was full of azaleas. It is our city flower of Wuxi, clusters, clusters, blooming so lively! Some of these rhododendrons are double-petaled and some are single-petaled. The double-petaled flowers bloom so heavily that they are clustered together, with a cluster of stamens standing in the middle. They drove in clusters in groups of three or five, as if their close friends were talking about something. Look, that single petal flower is not bad either. A few petals are gathered together, like a five-point star and a small trumpet, "ticking ticking" playing the hymns of spring. I couldn't help coming forward to smell it, ah, the faint fragrance passing by the tip of my nose was intoxicating! I put the Buddha in the sea of ​​flowers. The little bee smelled the scent, and flew to the flowers to sing wonderful songs; the little butterfly smelled the scent, climbed to the stamen, carrying a large bag of grain, and went home cheerfully ... As the saying goes, "Safflower I need a green leaf to line it up. ”Turn off the petals. The emerald green leaves are oval, like a green boat, touched by hand, furry, it is lined with flowers, flowers and leaves are more beautiful. Some of these rhododendrons are double-petaled and some are single-petaled.
