It ’s raining, it ’s raining! Raindrops, rustle ... the raindrops fell on the peach tree, and the peach tree was happy to have red flowers. The rain fell on the pear tree, and the pear tree was happy to have white flowers. The rain fell on the willow, and the willow spit green buds with joy. The rain fell on the field, and the seeds were happy to pour their mouths. The raindrops fell in the stream, and the frog was croaking with joy. Light rain, rustle, decorate the picturesque spring.
