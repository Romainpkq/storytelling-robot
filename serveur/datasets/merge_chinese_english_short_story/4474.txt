My cute little cat has a little cat. The little cats have small ears standing upright, and their eyes are round and round. It has eight beards by its mouth, which are thin, long, and hard. I know that it is used to measure the size of the hole in the mouse. The little flower cat is covered with yellow and black patterns all over its body. Only four paws are white, and there are five small paws like fish hooks. There is no sound when walking. It also has a long tail that always swings back and forth. During the day, the little cat always likes to sleep, and keeps snoring in his mouth. Once in the evening, it walked around here, and looked there, as if it was scouting for mouse activity. I really like this cute little cat.
