The grass is beside the road, on the banks of the river. The humble grass makes nature full of life. In spring, a slight spring breeze blew, and the grass and the partners who had just woken up danced cheerfully. They danced and grew with the spring breeze. In summer, the sun roasts the earth fiery. People came to the grass and sat on the grass. The grass held people in the arms like a loving mother, allowing the tired people to eliminate the fatigue caused by the heat. She never cares what people give, she would rather contribute to them. In the autumn, when a cool breeze blew, she suddenly became yellow-skinned. The cold wind invited winter, and the roots of the grass dig deep into the soil. When the next spring came, she came out of the soil again.
