Spring is like Ding Dong, Ding Dong! The creek tried a clear throat. Ah, spring comes with a song! Huh! Huh! Willow branches bend their soft waists, ah, spring is dancing! Beep, beep, spring bamboo shoots are happily jointed in the mud, ah, spring comes with firecrackers! Ah, spring comes with a song!
