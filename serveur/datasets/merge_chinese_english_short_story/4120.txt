The stream sang again. The stream lived at the foot of the mountain. The green mountains surrounded her, and the gurgling springs fed her. The clear streams reflect the red flowers and green grass around them, and the blue sky and white clouds overhead. The drizzle fell gently, and the stream sang happily: "Brother Drizzle, thank you for sending me a new partner. Now, I want to sing more beautifully!" The stream continued to move forward. The people who walked by the stream praised her: "What a beautiful and beautiful stream, and the singing of songs is so beautiful." The small stream was very proud of the praise. She stopped by a large bluestone and thought, "My water is so clear, so beautiful, why run again? Take a rest!" The stream didn't run, nor sang. Gradually, she became cloudy. Drizzle advised her: "Slow stream, keep going! Only by going forward can you be clear forever." After hearing the drizzle, the stream bypassed Daqingshi and sang again. The stream became clear again. Red flowers, green grass, blue sky, and white clouds were reflected in the stream again.
