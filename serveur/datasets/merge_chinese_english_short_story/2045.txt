Opening up the world It is said that a long time ago, the heaven and the earth were united together. It is boundless and looks like a big egg. In this "egg", Pangu, the ancestor of human beings, was conceived. One day, Pangu split the "egg" with his axe. In this way, light objects rise and become a high blue sky; heavy ones sink and become a vast land. Pangu was afraid that the heavens and the earth would come together, so he supported the heavens and earth with his hands and feet. Slowly, as Pangu grew longer and taller, the sky became higher and higher, and the ground became thicker and thicker. In the end Pangu spent 18,000 years to complete the ground-breaking task. In this "egg", Pangu, the ancestor of human beings, was conceived.
