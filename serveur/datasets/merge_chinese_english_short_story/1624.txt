The snowman "It's snowing! It's snowing!" Xiaohua took out his tools and rushed out of the yard with his friends in the same house, and piled up the snowman. Xiaohua first piled a big snowball with a dustpan as a snowman's body. Xiao Hong took out the bamboo pole and inserted it into the snowball. This is her hand. So the fat body is done. Xiaoli piled up a small head with a dustpan, and it was bad for his eyes, nose, and hat. By the way, iron buckets can be used as hats. Xiaogang took out two small round briquettes and a carrot from his home, pressed on the snowman's face, and drew a curved line with his fingers under the snowman's nose, ha! A snowman has been piled up. The little friends all laughed happily. By the way, iron buckets can be used as hats.
