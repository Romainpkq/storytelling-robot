Little Yu burst into tears in the little girl's tears. "Huh? Who is crying?" The little girl stopped crying and asked. "I am a little rain!" Said Xiaoyu, crying, "because you see nothing, I am sad for you!" "Thank you, little rain!" The little girl smiled, "I do n’t Cry, do n’t cry! You hear, there are so many little rains laughing, and singing happy songs, why do n’t we laugh! ”“ Yeah, we should all laugh, we should all be happy "" Xiaoyu stopped crying, laughing and singing with the little girl! The little girl ’s tears were dry, and the little rain disappeared. She also had a dream, dreaming that she had become a drop of seven-color little rain, and came into the little girl ’s eyes, and the little girl saw it with great pleasure. La!
