The brave little spiny one autumn afternoon, the weather was clear, the animals were having a picnic, and they had just eaten half of them. Suddenly, the big bad wolf came and swaggered. It said viciously, "Which of the many animals should I eat?" "The little animals were terrified when they saw them. They all flew away, and all ran away. Only little thorns left. The wolf came over and wanted to eat Lele. Lele said to himself: "Don't be afraid!" It bravely rushed up and shrunk into a mass of piercing the wolf with the thorns on his body. Ran away. The little animals came back, and they asked Lele: "What if the big bad wolf came back?" Lele said, "I'm not afraid of it! I can use the thorns on my body to deal with it." The little animals admire the brave little thorns so much that they are thrown into the ground!
