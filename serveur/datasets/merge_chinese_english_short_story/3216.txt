The little brown bear folds a small paper boat into the stream every day, and let the water float the small paper boat to the door of his good friend, the red squirrel. But one day, they quarreled, and the little brown bear would never fold a small paper boat to the red squirrel again. After a few days, the little brown bear felt very sad. He still folded the paper boat every day, but he didn't put the paper boat into the stream. The red squirrel wrote a few words of apology on the paper boat before the little brown bear, and let him float to the door of the little brown bear. They soon reconciled.
