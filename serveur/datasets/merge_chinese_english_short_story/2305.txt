Lights of Beijing City At night, Beijing City is full of lights. They are beautiful and beautiful. Vehicles on both sides of the road are flashing with lights, shuttles between them; the street lights on both sides are high, shining, like soldiers standing on guard; the tall residential buildings are lit, and people under the lights must be eating or reading, watching TV, Chat, the children must be playing or doing their homework; the bustling mall is lit with lights, the bustling crowds come in and out, some are preparing to go shopping, some are shopping, and go home happily with a satisfied smile; The Beijing Library is lit with lights. People inside must be seriously reading books or searching for information. The Central Television Tower is dressed in colored lights: red, yellow, blue, green, pink, and purple woven colored clothes. Very spectacular and beautiful. I like the city of Beijing at night. It is so peaceful, beautiful, and prosperous. I like the city of Beijing at night. It is so peaceful, beautiful, and prosperous.
