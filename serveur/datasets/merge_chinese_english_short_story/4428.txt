A group of animals are eating grass and a tiger is rushing in. The animals were frightened and fled, but the only rhino came forward and glared at each other. The tiger froze for a moment before turning around and leaving. The animals who watched from afar swarmed up and surrounded the warrior, singing a tribute to it. The tiger didn't go far, it spied far away. After a while, he saw that the rhinoceros had left this group of animals, and immediately returned to charge. The animals fled again and again. There was only a naive little lamb just born, who was not afraid, and greeted him with a pair of curious eyes, screaming intimately at the tiger. This little guy regards the tiger as his own mother-in-law and wants to eat its milk. The tiger didn't understand what was going on. For a moment, he turned away. The animals watching from afar flocked up again, and surrounded the little warrior who was not afraid of the tiger and sang praises to it.
