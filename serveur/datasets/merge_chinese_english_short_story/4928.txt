Big Tortoise We have a big tortoise in our house. It is tan and has a hard shell. There are 13 pentagonal scales in the middle of its shell and 27 quadrilateral scales around it, indicating that it is 27 years old. Its head looks like a snake, with a pointed mouth and a pair of small black eyes, four sharp claws and a small tail. The tortoise crawled very slowly. It raised its head and looked around for a while before it began to crawl. When he met the horse and retracted his head into the shell, he looked very cute. When the fishermen near the Yellow River found it, it was very sick. Under our careful care, it became healthy. When spring came, we were ready to send it back to the Yellow River to make it a happy life.
