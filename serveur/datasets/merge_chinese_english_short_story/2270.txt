Spring is here, and the water of the river is flowing wildly. The trees on the shore were green, the peach blossoms were blooming, and the wheat seedlings in the distance began to turn green. In this spring season, the teacher led the students to plant trees in the wild. Under the leadership of the teacher, some students digged pits, some lifted water, and some planted saplings. Everyone did a great job. Under the leadership of the teacher, some students digged pits, some lifted water, and some planted saplings. Everyone did a great job.
