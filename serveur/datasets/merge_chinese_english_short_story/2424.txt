Flaming Maple Leaf Today, I walked in the woods, looking for a flaming maple leaf. Whenever I pick up a maple leaf, I always think that I have found the hottest one. But before long, I found another piece that was even redder. Ah, I finally found one of the hottest maple leaves! It is redder than the morning glow and redder than the rose. It looks like my little palm. I stuck this reddest and hottest maple leaf on a piece of white paper and wrote a little poem to make a greeting card. I want to send this greeting card to my beloved teacher. Flaming Maple Leaf Today, I walked in the woods, looking for a flaming maple leaf.
