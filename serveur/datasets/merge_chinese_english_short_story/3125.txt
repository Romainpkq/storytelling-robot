The lovely little goldfish mother bought three lovely little goldfish for me today. The three goldfish have different colors. One is black, with two eyes bulging, like two small balls. One is red. Its mouth is round like the letter O in our pinyin. It likes to spit out white bubbles. There is also a colorful one, which is the most naughty, and it always swims first when it is fed with feed. I really like these little goldfishes. I must raise these goldfishes and find out more secrets about them.
