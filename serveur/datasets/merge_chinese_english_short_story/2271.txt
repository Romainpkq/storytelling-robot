A dark cloud of summer rain came over and blocked the dazzling hot light of the sun. Suddenly, "Wow ..." It began to rain. Countless raindrops, like pearls, and thick silver threads, sprinkled on the fields and ponds, and on the round lotus leaves. This time Cola broke the fish playing downstream of the lotus leaf, and it broke the panted frog by the pond. The dark clouds drifted away, the rain stopped, and the sun radiated a dazzling light again. But the leaves are greener, the flowers are redder, and the singing of the frogs is even happier. The dark clouds drifted away, the rain stopped, and the sun radiated a dazzling light again.
