Snowflakes fluttered For the first time I saw snow, I jumped and jumped happily. The snowflakes fluttered. I took off my gloves. A snowflake fell on my hand.

The snowflakes fluttered, and I stretched out my hands and started to make a snowman different from others. It has white eyes and a white nose, and hides a white scarf. Other children told me that the snowman 's nose should be red and the snowman' s eyes should be black. But I think that the snowman should be white ... Other children told me that the snowman's nose should be red and the snowman's eyes should be black.
