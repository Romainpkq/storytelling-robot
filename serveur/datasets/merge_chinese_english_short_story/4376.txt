Beautiful little pond There is a park near my house. There is a very beautiful pond in the park. The pond was filled with clear water, and the sparkling waves flickered under the sunshine and the breeze, like twin eyes with twinkling eyes. The pond is surrounded by tender green grass. From a distance, it looks very beautiful, like the creator put a thick green carpet on the ground. Sometimes when I play by the pond, I will also see a group of little birds flying happily over the pond. In the evening, the sky was covered with red glow, and the glow of the sun reflected on the water surface, like laying a layer of red, transparent yarn on the water surface. As night fell, the crooked moon reflected on the surface of the water, like a small boat gently rippling in the water waves; and the stars reflected on the surface of the water, like the shining pearls, kept jumping in the water waves. What a beautiful little pond!
