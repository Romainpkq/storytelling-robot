There is an old locust tree on the campus, tall and sturdy. It is said to be tall and not excessive at all. Its treetops are about to hit the top of the three-story building. It is indeed stout enough to say that it is stout, and its gray-brown trunk cannot be hugged by two children. The straight trunk held up a huge crown, like a big green umbrella. Dense leaves cover the sun tightly, and students like to play and play under the tree. A gust of wind blew through the treetops, and the leaves clattered, and it seemed that the old locust tree also laughed with us.
