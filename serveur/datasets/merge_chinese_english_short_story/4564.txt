Little White Rabbit wants to build a building, but I do nâ€™t know which floor to live on. Go to the rooster to discuss: "Brother Rooster, which floor do I live on?" The cock said, "Brother White Rabbit, you still live on the second floor, second floor. It's warm in winter and cool in summer. "On the day of construction, the father-in-law came, and he persuaded the little white rabbit to lay the foundation well, otherwise, the building would fall. The little white rabbit said, "It doesn't matter, I live on the second floor." The old goat shook his head and left. The building of the little white rabbit was just finished, and there was heavy rain under "Boom". The black soil under the building became mud, and the building fell. On the second floor where the little white rabbit will live, it is torn to the east and west to the ground and collapsed on the ground.
