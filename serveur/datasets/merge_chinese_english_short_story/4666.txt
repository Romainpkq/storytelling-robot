The little fireflies of summer night, flying low on the grass of summer night, carrying a small red light, attentively watching this world of flowers and plants. Fireflies, don't you think your lights are too small? Don't you think you are burning yourself? The firefly didn't answer. It was still flying around, carrying its beautiful red light burning with life, flying among the thousands of flowers.
