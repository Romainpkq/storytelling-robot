Autumn girl Grasshopper is still screaming, her throat is dumb. Everyone is looking forward to it, autumn girl is finally here, she flew down with the wild geese from the high blue sky. Burning torches danced in the sorghum field. A string of bean bells rang in the bean field. Kissing apple faces in the orchard. A small red flag floated on the maple------The autumn girl walked all over our hometown. Her footprints were yellow and red. Every footprint was full of our laughter.
