The light rain and the small tree are raining, it is raining, the small tree is mumbling and drinking. It stretches its leaves and grows green and strong. The small tree happily said to the raindrops, "Light rain, light rain, thank you!" Raindrop said, "Don't worry, I'd like to help you." Raindrop said, "Don't worry, I'd love to help you."
