The lovely big flower clock is here in spring. The little bees are really hardworking. They came to the garden early in the morning to gather nectar. It flew from flower to flower to gather honey. Suddenly, Sunflower said to the bee: "Resume for a while, it's time to go home for lunch." The little bee asked, "Is it noon? How do you know?" Sunflower said mysteriously: "We have a big clock here Ah! "The little bee looked around:" Where is the big flower clock? "The lark flew over and fluttered her beautiful wings, and said with a smile:" Little bee, I know where, let's go and see this big flower Bell! "So he flew to a large flower plate. Although there were many flowers in it, most of them were not in bloom, only one flower was blooming. The lark said: "This kind of flower is called" noon flower ". She only opened it at noon. She is blooming at noon, of course!" The little bee asked, "Is the flower opening time fixed?" The lark said: "Of course, different flowers will open at different times: hops open at three o'clock in the morning, petunias generally bloom at four o'clock, roses bloom at five o'clock, solanum flowers bloom at six o'clock, peony flowers open at seven o'clock, lotus flowers It opens at 8 o'clock and at 10 o'clock is the Scutellaria barbata. "" There is no alarm clock, the biological clock in their body wakes them up! "" I learned a way to master time again! "The little bee said happily.
