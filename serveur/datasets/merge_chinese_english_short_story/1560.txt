There is a flock of birds in the yard of the bird's house. Puppy, rabbit and cat want to build a comfortable home for the birds so that they can live in the yard forever. The kitten made a beautiful bird cage. The little bird looked at it, whine, and flew away. The puppy made a beautiful log cabin. The bird looked at it, and shook its head. The little rabbit planted a tree. The tree sprouts, the little bird is cricketing, singing and playing in the green leaves. Puppies and kittens understand: Trees are the best homes for birds.
