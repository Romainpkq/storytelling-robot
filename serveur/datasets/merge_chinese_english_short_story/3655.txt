In ancient China, there was a beast called "nian". Its head has long tentacles and is fierce and unusual. It comes out every New Year's Eve to devour livestock and hurt lives. People are very afraid. Later, an immortal told people that putting red paper on the doors and windows, and setting off firecrackers would scare away "years." On New Year's Eve again, people did what the fairy said, and it really scared away the "year". Since then, every year on New Year's Eve, every family has posted red couplets, set off firecrackers, and every household is lit brightly and stays up all night. Early in the morning on the first day of the first day, I still have to visit friends and relatives to say hello. These customs are widely circulated, and the year has become the most grand traditional festival of Chinese folk.
