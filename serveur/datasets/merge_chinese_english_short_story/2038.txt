The good companion bear is ill and is admitted to the hospital. The little companions come to visit him. The little monkey arrived and gave the bear a peach. The bee flew and gave the bear honey. The lark also flew in, and it brought a lovely song to the bear. The little bear was very moved, and said in a continuous voice: "Thank you, thank you!" The good friend, Little Bear, was sick and was admitted to the hospital. The little friends came to visit him.
