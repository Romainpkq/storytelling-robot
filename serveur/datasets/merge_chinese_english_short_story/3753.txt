Red flowers and green leaves are here in spring, and the flowers are blooming. The flower is blooming. How beautiful it is. People take pictures of it. The flower is blooming, so fragrant, and the bees are spinning around it. Huaer smiled, but Huaer was happy. The flower smiled, and a flower became proud. It can't look at the green leaves around it, and feels that the leaves are ordinary, and nobody looks at it, it's too ordinary. While a gust of wind was blowing, the flower fell hard from the tree and left the green leaves. The flower fluttered with the wind, and fluttered. It didn't take long for the flower to dry up, like a pile of waste paper, and was swept into the garbage dump by people. When the other flowers met, they would never dare to leave the green leaves again. Only then did they understand that the green leaves were silent, and they worked hard to produce all kinds of nutrients in the sun to supply themselves. With green leaves, our flowers are red; with green leaves, our flowers are fragrant; with green leaves, our flowers are able to bear fruit.
