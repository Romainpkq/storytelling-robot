My sister gave me a pair of little turtles. I named them Tintin and Dongdong. They live together every day, get along well and never fight. Tintin has short arms and legs, but he is very flexible. Dong Dong's eyes are very bright and sacred, just like wearing a pair of glasses, really like a little doctor. Every day, I have to let them play on the balcony. Tintin is very naughty. He always likes to climb to Dong Dong's back and bask in the sun. He tanned his back, turned over again, and turned his belly up into the sky. It looked very fun. It is rare that Dong Dong is not angry at all. They are really good friends! They are cute and timid. As long as I am teasing them with a small stick, they will scare their heads into their shells and dare not come out for a long time. I really like these two little turtles. Tintin is very naughty. He always likes to climb to Dong Dong's back and bask in the sun.
