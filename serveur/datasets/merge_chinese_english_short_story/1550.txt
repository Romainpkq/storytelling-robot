A spider is weaving a web. It had just been woven a few times and a strong wind blew off the wire. The spider weaved again, just half of it, and a shower of rain hit it, breaking the web. The spider was not angry and weaved again, but a hailstone broke the web again. The spider was not discouraged, and weaved again. Weaving, weaving, and finally weavingâ€”a large, strong net. The spider happily sat in the middle of the web and caught the pests flying around. The spider happily sat in the middle of the web and caught the pests flying around.
