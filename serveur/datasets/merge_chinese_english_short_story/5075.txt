Tree family I walk into the world of the forest. I have never seen so many trees: there are red pine, lime tree, willow, birch ... they form a big and harmonious family. Red pine, like a kind grandpa, linden tree, like a burly dad, willow tree, like a beautiful mother, and little birch, like a smart sister. Walking into the tree's family, I think of my home.
