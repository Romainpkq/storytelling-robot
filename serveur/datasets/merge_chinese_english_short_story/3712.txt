I have a good friend, a small alarm clock placed beside my pillow. Its round body, shiny face, and three pointers, like three small arms, "tick and tick" and keep turning, very lovable. When I went to bed at night, the small alarm clock whispered to me; when I slept soundly in the morning, it awakened me and urged me to go to school. I really like my little alarm clock!
