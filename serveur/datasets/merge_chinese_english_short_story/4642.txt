To help others is to help yourself. A businessman is walking carefully on a dark road, regretting why he didn't bring a lighting tool when he went out. Suddenly, a little light appeared in front of him, and he gradually approached. The lights illuminate the nearby road, and the merchant walks along the road a little smoother. When he approached the light, he realized that the man walking with the lantern turned out to be a blind man who was blind with both eyes. The businessman asked the blind man very strangely, "Why are you playing lanterns? Are you afraid of wasting lamp oil?" After hearing the question, the blind man replied slowly: "I didn't play lanterns for others, but It ’s because walking in the dark, people often ca n’t see me, and I can easily be hit by someone. And I walk with a lantern. Although the light ca n’t help me see the way ahead, it can let others see me. Will not be hit by anyone. "
