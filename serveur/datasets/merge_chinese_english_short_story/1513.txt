Look at the lotus flowers. Some lotus leaves in the pond are like an open umbrella, some are big green discs, and some are like a small fan. Through the gap of the lotus leaf, I saw the lotus stalks with thorns sticking up on the water. The top of the lotus stem is covered with snow-white lotus flowers. The lotus flowers are in various poses, one after another, some have already bloomed, revealing golden flower stamens and yellowish small lotus tents; some have two or three petals spread out. Lovely fairies; some are still bracted. One of the newly opened lotuses seemed shy and hid behind a large lotus leaf. Through the gap of the lotus leaf, I saw the lotus stalks with thorns sticking up on the water.
