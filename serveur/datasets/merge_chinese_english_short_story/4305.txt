I am a weather forecaster. Do nâ€™t look at my young age, but I can see that wind and rain change a lot; Dongqing and Xiwang do not wait for dinner. Swallows are going to rain. The frog calls, the ants move, and the fish rolls under heavy rain. Sunny and rainy days I knew that I was a weather forecaster.
