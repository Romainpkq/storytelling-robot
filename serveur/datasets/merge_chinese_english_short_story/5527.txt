The lion and the fox lion are old and unable to capture the beast, so he wants to live his life by tricks. He burrowed into a cave, lying down and pretending to be sick. Many beasts came to visit him in the cave and were eaten by him. The fox saw his tricks and stood at the entrance of the cave and said, "Lion King, how is he doing?" The lion said: "I'm not in good health. Why don't you come in?" The fox replied: "Because I see many footprints —— There are a lot of holes, but there are no holes, so I wo n’t go in. ”
