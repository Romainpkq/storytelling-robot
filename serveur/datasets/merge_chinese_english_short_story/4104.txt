At this time, there are already many people on the beach, some of them catch crabs, some catch sea fish, some collect shells ... I feel in the sea, hey, I caught a little starfish ! Hey, a little friend over there, looking down at something with his head down. I walked over and wanted to see what happened. My little friend only kept his mouth and said nothing. It turned out to be a crab who was not willing to catch his hand and fled from east to west. Suddenly, the little friend "oops" cried out, it turned out that the crab caught his hand with a big claw. Huh, why are my feet tickling? Looking down, oh, it turned out that a prawn was teasing me! It wobbled two long beards, like a general on the stage. I gently reached out my hand, and with just a pinch, the general became a captive of me, and I couldn't get angry anymore.
