Pear, pour ... The rain in spring falls at night and stops at dawn. The rain in spring is a thump: dong dong, dong dong! Beating the large banana leaves, the sound is so sweet and crisp. The rain in spring is the keys: Dingdong, Dingdong! The calm Koike was struck, and the sound was so gentle and pleasant. The rain in spring is the paint: it stains the green grass and leaves, and reddens the wildflowers and mangosteens. The rain in spring is a lullaby: the children have just woken up from their dreams and walked into another sweet dream.
