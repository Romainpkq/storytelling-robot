Beautiful spring is so beautiful! Because in the spring, the plants that "sleeped" for a winter will spit out their leaves and show their richness! The forest is awake! The animals in the forest changed into spring clothes: the little rabbit took off the "grey clothes" and changed into the "white clothes"; the grasshopper took off the "white clothes" and changed into the "green clothes" ... it was really colorful. The little rabbit said: "Our animals are the most beautiful in the spring!" Huaer retorted: "Aren't our plants also in a variety of poses?" Really, catkins on the willow are like cotton, flowers on the peach are like flowers, and pine and cypress trees are full of flowers ...... The plant kingdom in the forest is really Yinggeyanwu, butterfly dance and bee flying!
