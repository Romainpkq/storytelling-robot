Clouds are in the sky like sapphires, and white clouds are floating like snow. They have limited ticket friends in the blue sky. A cloud changes its image in the sky. Sometimes, the cloud is like a little goat, running freely, and soon merges into the cloud group; sometimes, the cloud is like a bird flying from a distance, it expands little by little, and gradually blurs, It became a big cloud. At different times, the clouds have different changes. Some are like cows, some are like rabbits, and some are like chickens ... In the morning, the rising sun sets a beautiful golden rim on the clouds, passing through the gaps between the clouds, the sun shoots 10,000 The golden light, shone in the wilderness, shone on the balcony of my house. At night, the little stars blinked, and several clouds in the sky were slowly swimming, blocking the little stars like a light streamer. No wonder I saw some stars appearing and disappearing when I walked.
