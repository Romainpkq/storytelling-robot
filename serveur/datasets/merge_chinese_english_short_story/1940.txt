Grandma 's Small Mountain Village Grandma lives in a beautiful small mountain village. Today, we took bus number 9 to grandma's house. After getting out of the car, we embarked on a winding mountain path. On both sides of the mountain road were tall and erect trees, not far from the tea gardens, two or three tea farmers were picking tea, and there was a large field of green wheat. Several farmers are mowing near and far. We are getting closer and closer to Grandma 's house. See, Xiaoshan Village is green everywhere, green grass, green trees, green wheat fields, green tea leaves, and even my breath is full of green. Finally arrived at grandma 's house. Look, there is a wide and large pond in front of Grandma's house. There are a few ducks swimming freely in the water. The western part of the pond is a willow girl with long braids. The wicker is blown by the wind. Wagging gently, as if dancing! Ah, how beautiful the small mountain village of the grandmother 's family is! The grandmother of the small mountain village of the grandmother' s family lives in a beautiful small mountain village.
