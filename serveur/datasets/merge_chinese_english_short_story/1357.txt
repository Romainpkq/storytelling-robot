Little cats Make friends Little cats visit grandma. A small yellow dog lies under the big tree at the village entrance. The little cat kicked him, and the little yellow dog barked, and pounced on the little cat. The cat was so scared that it turned around and ran, tripped over the roots of the tree, and fell into the mud. The eighth brother on the tree laughed. The little cat was venting his stomach fire, and scolded him: "Close your stinky mouth!" Starling also said politely: "Close your stinky mouth!" You have to wipe your tears straight: "Grandma, little yellow dog and my eighth bully me." Grandma said distressed: "My little obedient, just blame you for being too disrespectful of others. If you are polite to others, others will treat you too Friendly! "After listening to the grandmother's words, Xiaohua cat kindly said to the little yellow dog," I'm sorry! "Xiaohua cat said to the starling brother," Friend, hello! "Starling also said to the Xiaohua cat," Friend, hello! " The little flower cat said happily: "Grandma, I understand. To be good to others, you must be good to others!" Grandma said distressed: "My little obedient, just blame you for not respecting others.
