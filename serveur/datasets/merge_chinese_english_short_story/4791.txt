Bless you, little swallows, I walked in the park in the morning and found a little swallow that fell to the ground. I was determined to send it home. I cautiously held the little swallow, holding my head sideways, looking at the tree as I walked. Suddenly, I found a "soil nest", is that the nest of the little swallows? I take a closer look, yo, there are two big swallows in the nest! At this moment, the little thing could not help crying, like saying: "Yes, yes, this is it!" But the big swallow flew away in fright when he saw me. I placed the little swallow under "Tuwowo" and looked behind the big tree. I saw that the two big swallows fell gently beside the little swallows, yelling, the three swallows are so affectionate! Looking at their family reunion, I couldn't help laughing. what ! Little Swallow, I wish you all the best and hope that you can grow up smoothly and make greater contributions to mankind.
