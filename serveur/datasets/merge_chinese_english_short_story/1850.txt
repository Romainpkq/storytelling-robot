Hundreds of species of seabirds live on the Xisha Islands in the South China Sea. The most numerous are white birds. This white bird loves fish most. They hunt for fish on the sea in groups and fly back to the island in the evening. The largest seabird is called an albatross. Its wings are as long as two desks. It often spreads its wings and flies at sea, and can fly for hundreds of miles before it stops. It often spreads its wings and flies at sea, and can fly for hundreds of miles before it stops.
