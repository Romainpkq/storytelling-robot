The little tropical fish looks pretty. It has a triangular shape, a golden body, and black markings. The tail is black, but also a triangle. There are a pair of small round eyes on the head and a pointed mouth with small bubbles spitting out. Interestingly, there are two curved and long beards under the mouth!
