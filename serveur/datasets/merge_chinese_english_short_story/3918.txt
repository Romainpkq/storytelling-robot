Once, when I admired the coin, I saw three Chinese characters "Japan" on the Japanese coin. I didn't understand why Japan also used Chinese characters, so I asked my father. My dad said: "During the Tang Dynasty, we had cultural exchanges with Japan. At that time, Japan had no native scripts. When we saw the beautiful Chinese scripts, we borrowed some of the Chinese characters and created our own scripts. Until now, there are thousands Ten thousand Chinese characters are used in Japan. "
