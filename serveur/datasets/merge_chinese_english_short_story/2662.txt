The scenery of the park is so beautiful Today, the sun is shining and there are a few white clouds floating in the blue sky. My parents and I are rowing in the lake in the park. The scenery in the park is so beautiful! There is a small bridge in the distance. At the end of the small bridge is a pavilion. The pavilion is filled with adults and children, and is surrounded by colorful flowers. The lawn by the lake is also very lively. The birds are singing a gentle song on the tree. A group of children are playing the eagle-and-chicken game under the big tree. There is also a beautiful big rooster striding forward with a big chest. . On the lake is a group of beautiful white swans. They are playing and playing happily ... the park scenery is so beautiful! Sitting at the bow of the boat, I could n’t help but sing loudly, and my father and mother sang softly to me as they rowed the boat: “It ’s sunny today, the scenery is good, the scenery ...” There is a small bridge in the distance, at the end of the bridge It's a pavilion. The pavilion is full of adults and children, and it is surrounded by colorful flowers.
