Spring is here, snow and ice knows that it is running water bouncing; spring is here, little grass knows, gets out of its head and looks around; spring is here, wind knows, blowing green fields and birds; spring is coming, The child knows that the higher the sky, the higher the kite. Spring is here, and the child knows that the higher the sky on the kite, the higher it goes.
