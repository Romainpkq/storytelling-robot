Forest, hello one tree, two trees, many trees. Holding hands, side by side, a green ocean. Hello, green big forest! Hello, green big forest! The little bird said, "The forest stretches out the green umbrella, this is my home." The little deer said, "The tent is set up in the forest. This is my home." Hello, green big forest! The sand said that the forest is a wall, let us obey and not run around. The rain said, the forest is a reservoir, let me stay!
