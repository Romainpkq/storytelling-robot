Once upon a time, there were two generals. They went to buy a shield together. The shield man picked up a shield and showed them. The general standing on the left of the shield looked at it and said, "This gold shield is very good!" The general standing on the right said, "You're wrong, this is a silver shield." The two generals argued like this. The shield man said, "This shield is gold on one side and silver on the other. How can you look at only one side?" The general standing on the right said, "You are wrong, this is a silver shield."
