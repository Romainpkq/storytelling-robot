The cold wind of the deciduous trees was blowing in a burst, and the yellow leaves flew down gently in the cold wind. But pine trees and holly are dressed in green clothes all year round. They are very beautiful. Why is this? It turned out that the leaves of the pine tree are needles, like needles, the water will not slip away from the leaves, they are not afraid of lack of water, so they do not need to fall leaves. The leaves of Holly are broad, and the leaves are covered with a layer of wax-like things, and the moisture will not slip away, so they do not decay in winter. In fact, they are sometimes falling leaves, and only careless children say that they will not fall leaves. After they have fallen leaves, new leaves will continue to grow.
