The cradle of the caterpillar is leaves, and the nest of butterflies is petals. Singing birds have a comfortable nest, hard-working bees, live in beautiful large dormitories, clear rivers, swim in fish and shrimp, and the green big field is the home of the dragonfly. The poor wind has no home. It runs around and can't find a place to rest. The drifting cloud is homeless, and when the sky is overcast, tears rush out. We are the happiest! As soon as we are born, our parents are ready for home. Let us grow up safely at home. As soon as we are born, our parents are ready for home. Let us grow up safely at home.
