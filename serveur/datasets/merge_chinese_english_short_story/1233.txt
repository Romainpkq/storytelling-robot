Tree Doctor People say that the woodpecker is a hardworking tree doctor. The woodpecker's mouth is sharp and hard, like a chisel. The tongue is thin and long, and the tongue has hooks. The woodpecker found that there were pests under the bark, so he pecked the bark first, then stuck out his tongue with hooks, strung the pests one by one, and finally brought out the worms and eggs with saliva.
