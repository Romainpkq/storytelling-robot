Interesting sun and moon shells There is an interesting shell in the sea near the Xisha Islands in China. It has two round shells, one facing down to the bottom of the sea, one who doesn't see sunlight in adulthood, is white and white, like the moon; the other is upward, often shining in sunlight, red and red, like the sun. People call it "Sun Moon Bay". When the sun and the moon were swimming, the two shells quickly joined one by one, drained forward, and swam as fast as a bird, so someone called it a "flying shell." The other one is facing up and often shines with sunlight. The color is red, like the sun. People call it "sun and moon".
