I am a space shuttle. My job is to send all kinds of satellites to space and bring the faulty satellites back to the ground for inspection and repair. My body is big and heavy at first, and it â€™s even heavier with satellites or something. So I had to be sent to the sky by a rocket. After reaching a height of 43 kilometers, I was able to fly into space orbit by myself and keep flying around the earth. I am more advanced than a spaceship. When returning to the ground, I can taxi and land on my own like an airplane, so I can reuse it instead of scrapping it like a rocket just once. So I had to be sent to the sky by a rocket.
