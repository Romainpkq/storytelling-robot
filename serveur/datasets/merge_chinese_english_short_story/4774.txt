One day, the rooster and the duck are more powerful than anyone. They run before running. The rooster ran with the fly and dragged the duck down a long way. The duck could not catch up with the swing of the duck. The cock said triumphantly to the duck: "You can believe that my skills are greater!" They are better than swimming. The duck swam fast and steady, the rooster covered with water, almost drowned. The duck also proudly said to the rooster: "It's still my skill." No one will obey anyone.
