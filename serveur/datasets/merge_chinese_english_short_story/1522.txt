One day, the careless little monkey listened to the teacher and said, "The fruit is red and so sweet ..." The little monkey slipped out of the classroom and ran to the wild without listening. what ! The apples on the tree are red, so go pick a big mouthful and eat it, it's so sweet! When he saw that the peaches were big and red again, he went to pick them, and the peaches were sweet and thirsty. He thinks the teacher is right, the red fruits are all sweet. As he walked, he saw a patch of hot peppers. The red hot peppers were like little lanterns, which made people love. The little monkey picked a big red one and put it in his mouth. what ! The hot little monkey was sweating. He desperately ran back to school and asked the teacher, "Why isn't this red fruit sweet?" The teacher said, "The red ones are not necessarily all sweet. I haven't finished talking yet, why did you run away? The little monkey listened, and bowed his head in embarrassment. Since then, the little monkey has studied very hard and has become a good student. When he saw that the peaches were big and red again, he went to pick them, and the peaches were sweet and thirsty.
