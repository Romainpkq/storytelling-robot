The lotus pond is really fun. There is a shallow pond next to my house. The pond is full of lotus leaves and full of lotus flowers. The round and large lotus leaf is like a green umbrella that has been stretched out. It can be shaded when hiding inside. The pink lotus flowers are more beautiful than any flowers. They grow in the middle of the green lotus leaves and dress the small pond so beautifully! My friends and I like to play in the lotus pond the most. Hiding in a large basin, gently paddling with your hands, swaying, swaying into the lotus, hiding under the lotus leaf to cool off in the wind, listening to the croaking of frogs. It's raining, the raindrops hit the lotus leaf, ticking, like it really is the "umbrella" propped on our heads!
