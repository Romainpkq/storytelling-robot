The song written to my dad is a strong man, can stand me on my shoulder, I can see higher and farther, can hold me ram hammer upside down, it is fun to touch my head on the sofa, can hold me in my hand I am sitting on the sofa, I can pull out the "radish" many times, my neck is tired but I feel very irritated. My dad is a big housekeeper. I take care of it every day, and do nâ€™t let me take dirty insects home, eat me without washing my hands, keep me from watching TV every day, keep me from doing homework too close, he let I play outside with children more often, he told me to do things with my chest up, he told me to learn mathematics well, he told me to watch on both sides of the road. Dad is a hilarious pie. He ate down the window and went downstairs after dinner every day and said, "Oh, hello! I have eaten!" He wanted to deceive mom and me like this. Step, twisting his butt and twisting his legs, he wanted to make me and my mother laugh like this, he opened the balcony window and laughed and cried when he came back after drinking too much, and he clapped his hands "papa", my mom and I called him " "Alcohol Madman". Dad's work is very hard, I want to be filial to him.
