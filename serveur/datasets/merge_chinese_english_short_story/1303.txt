The father asked him why he wanted to take the younger, and he replied, "Because I am young, of course I should take the younger, and leave the older one for my brother to eat." The father listened and praised him for being polite. The father asked him why he wanted to take the smaller ones, and he replied, "Because I am young, of course I should take the smaller ones, and leave the older ones for my brother to eat."
