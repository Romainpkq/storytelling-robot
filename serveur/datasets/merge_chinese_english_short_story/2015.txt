The mother of plants has a way. The mother of dandelions prepared a parachute and gave it to her doll. As long as the wind blows gently, the children set off in the wind. Xan's mother has a good idea. She puts her child on a barbed armor. As long as the animal 's fur is hung up, the children can go to the fields and mountains. The mother pea has a better way. She let the pods bask in the sun. With a pop, the pods exploded, and the children jumped away from their mother. As long as the wind blows gently, the children set off in the wind.
