The little squirrel looked for the peanut tree. There were many peanuts, green leaves, and small yellow flowers, which looked really good. The little squirrel asked the earthworm, "What is this?" The earthworm said, "This is peanuts." The little squirrel was very happy, and he thought, when the peanuts had settled, I would pick them up and keep them for winter. Since then, the little squirrel has gone into the peanut field every day to see if the peanuts have turned out. However, until the golden flowers were gone, I didn't see a peanut fruit. The little squirrel opened his eyes wide and said to himself, "Strange, who has taken the peanut fruit?" The earthworm got out of the soil, and said to the little squirrel with a smile, "No one has picked the peanut fruit. It's inside! "" Earthworms got out of the soil and smiled and said to the little squirrel, "No one has picked them. The peanuts are all in the soil!"
