Moon Bay My home is in Moon Bay. Moon Bay is a beautiful village. There is a crescent creek in front of the village, and there is a stone bridge on the river. The river flows slowly around the village, and a school of fish swims in the river. The clear river reflects the small bridge, green trees and Castle Peak. There are many peach trees on the river bank. In spring, the trees are full of peach blossoms. From afar, they look like a green farmland. Behind the village is a mountain, and there is a tea tree on the hillside. Moon Bay is so beautiful! I love Moon Bay.
