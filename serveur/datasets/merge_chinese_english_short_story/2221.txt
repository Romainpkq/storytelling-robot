Light rain, light rain. The light rain polished the road, the light rain polished the roof, and the light rain polished my shoes. Alas, it's light rain. The light rain polished the big trees, the light rain polished the mountains, and the light rain polished my umbrella. Light rain is a small brush, light rain is a mirror, light rain is a elephant's nose. Booming, light rain is growing up. Light rain is a small brush, light rain is a mirror, light rain is a elephant's nose.
