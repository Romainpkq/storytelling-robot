On the day of carrying the water, the mother didn't call, and the mother got up. She gently pushed open the door, and saw a figure in the hazy night, pouring the water into the water tank with difficulty carrying the bucket. The mother hurried over to take a look, it turned out to be her son Zhu De. The mother felt Zhu De's tender shoulders for a while and felt sad. "Mother, don't worry, I can do it!" As he said, Zhu De picked up the bucket again and walked out of the kitchen. Looking at the back of the sensible child, the mother thought: "It's really happy to be so considerate to elders and hard-working at such a young age!"
