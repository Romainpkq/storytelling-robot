Once upon a time, there was a teacher who gave a question to students: see who can buy a thing with little money and can fill the study room. After school, the students went to the market. Some bought straw, some bought saplings, some bought cotton ... but no one could fill the study with anything. A student named Han Yu walked into the study, took out a candle from his sleeve and lit it. The candlelight lit the whole room at once. After seeing him, he said happily, "Okay! Okay! Han Yu is so smart!" But no one was able to fill the study room.
