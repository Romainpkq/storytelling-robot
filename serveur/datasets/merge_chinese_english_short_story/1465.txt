Grandpa Deng Xiaoping's Arbor Day The Arbor Day in 1985 was an unforgettable day. On this day, there were no clouds in the sky, and the spring breeze was blowing. Among the tree planting crowd in Tiantan Park, the 81-year-old grandpa Deng Xiaoping was particularly noticeable. I saw that he was digging a tree pit with a shovel in his hands. His forehead was covered with sweat beads, and he still refused to rest. A tree pit was dug. Grandpa Deng picked a strong cypress seedling, carefully moved it into the tree pit, and filled it with a few shovel. He stood a few steps and looked closely, and felt that it was not very straight. He continued to say "No, no!" He stepped forward and straightened the sapling again. A small green cypress was planted and stood there straight like a soldier. Grandpa Deng had a satisfied smile on his face. Today, the cypress tree planted by Grandpa Deng himself has grown up, and the "Xiaoping Tree" has become a beautiful scenery in Tiantan Park.
