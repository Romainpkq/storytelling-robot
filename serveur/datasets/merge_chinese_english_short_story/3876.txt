The scene on the beach is really wonderful. There are all kinds of shells everywhere, some are white, some are red, some are yellow, some are pink and blue ... colorful. Their shapes are really funny, some are round and smooth on their backs; some are conical, with patterns winding down circle by circle; and others are like various small animals, which come to life.
