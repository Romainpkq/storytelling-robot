There are many wonderful plants in the world. Plants can eat bugs. In summer, a kind of pink grass is often seen in swamps. This is the felt moss that can catch flying insects. There are more than 200 small villi on the leaves of Felt Moss. These small villi can secrete a very viscous liquid. This viscous liquid also contains a very sweet taste and aroma. When the small insects smell this odor, Hurrying to fly, once it falls on its leaves, it will be firmly stuck. After 1 to 2 hours, the worms are digested and absorbed by the leaves. Plants also listen to music. An Indian scientist often likes playing the violin in the garden and playing a symphony. As time went by, he found that the flowers and trees in his garden grew extraordinarily lush. So he began to formally test rice. He plays a 25-minute symphony in a paddy field every day. One month later, it was found that the rice in this field grew more lush than the same rice that had not heard music, with an average plant height of more than 30 cm.
