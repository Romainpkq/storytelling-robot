Animal mothers bring dolls Animal mothers have various ways to bring dolls. The mother chicken always stretched out her wings and hugged the chicken doll. There is a big pocket on the kangaroo mother's belly, and the dolls are often contained in it, like a big cradle. The most interesting thing is that there is a kind of fish called cichlids, and small fish dolls often get into the mother's mouth. Liyu's mother's mouth is the doll's home.
