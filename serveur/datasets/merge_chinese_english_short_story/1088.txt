Winter has passed and spring comes to me unknowingly. Spring is on the branch. The sprouts quietly came out and dressed the branches green. Spring is in the garden. The flowers are in bloom, there are red, pink, golden ... colorful, so beautiful! The most attractive thing is the pansy, like a group of flowers and butterflies spreading wings, dancing. In the vast fields in spring, the broad beans and rapes that the farmer uncle worked so hard to produce have white and golden small flowers, exuding a burst of fragrance. Spring is here, the motherland is spring everywhere, I love the spring of the motherland! Winter has passed and spring comes to me unknowingly.
