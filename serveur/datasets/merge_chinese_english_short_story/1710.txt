Little white rabbit wants to build a building, but I don't know which floor to live in. Go to the rooster to discuss: "Brother rooster, which floor should I live in?" The rooster said, "Brother White Rabbit, you still live on the second floor. The building is warm in winter and cool in summer. "On the day when construction started, the goat father came, and he advised the little white rabbit to lay the foundation, otherwise the building would fall. The little white rabbit said, "It doesn't matter. I live on the second floor." The old goat shook his head and left. Little White Rabbit's building was just finished, and it was raining heavily in the "Booming". The black soil below the building turned into mud, and the building fell down. On the second floor where the little white rabbit was to live, it broke to the east and one to the west, and fell to the ground. On the second floor where the little white rabbit was going to live, it broke to the east and one to the west, and fell to the ground.
