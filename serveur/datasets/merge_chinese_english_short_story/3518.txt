Autumn is coming, autumn wind is blowing, and the weather is getting cooler. The children followed the teacher to the countryside. The blue sky is endless, and white clouds play in the sky. Sometimes they look like a group of white rabbits, sometimes they look like a few sheep, and sometimes they look like cute little dogs. In the farmland, the rice is yellow, the sorghum is red, and the cotton is white. Children are rolling on the grass, flying kites, laughing, shouting, how happy!
