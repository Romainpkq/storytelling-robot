My mark I am very short, with small eyes, small noses, and small mouths concentrated on my face, but the pair of big ears is particularly conspicuous. When I was young, I was very mischievous. Therefore, my ears often suffer like this: Papa pulls the left ear, and mom pulls the right ear to punish me for not. I heard my mother said that when I fell to the ground, she noticed a small ear on my right ear at a glance, and determined that it was my mark, and thought it was her inheritance. Everyone who has seen me at one glance says that I am very smart, and that I must be very productive and blessed in the future. I asked them why it was, they said, "Because you have a little ear longer than others."

"Actually, do people have any future in the future, whether they will have blessings, and have nothing to do with their ears. They must rely on their own diligence and hard work. Do you think so?
