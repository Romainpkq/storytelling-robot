Uncle Gray Cat "Xiu Xiu" gave me a little cat named "Xiu Xiu". From a distance, "Xiu Xiu" looks like a majestic little tiger: a pair of sparkling eyes are embedded on his face, and a long beard is grown near the corner of his mouth; a gray hair feels very comfortable to touch; The long tail is always tilted upwards. So cute ! "Xiu Xiu" is a good mouse trap. One night I found "Xiuxiu" hiding near a mouse's hole in the corner. After a while, a big mouse came out of the hole and "Xiu Xiu" swooped on. Unexpectedly the mouse screamed and ran away from "Xiu Xiu" 's paw. "Xiu Xiu" Where would you let it go! "噌, 噌, 噌" a few times, then pressed the mouse under the claws. "Xiu Xiu" was not in a hurry to eat the mouse. I saw it tossed the mouse into the air, and the mouse ran away as soon as it landed, but did not wait for the mouse to run two steps. The front paws kicked the rat around, and it was a beautiful meal until it tortured the rat so that it would not move. One night I found "Xiuxiu" hiding near a mouse's hole in the corner.
