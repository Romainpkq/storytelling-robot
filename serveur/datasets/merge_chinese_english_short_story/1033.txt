A group of animals was grazing and a tiger rushed. The animals were so scared that they ran away, but only one rhino came forward and glared at each other. The tiger nodded and turned around and left. The animals who watched from a distance swarmed up, and surrounded the warrior, singing praises to it. The tiger hasn't gone far, it is spying far away. After a while, when he saw the rhino leaving the group of animals, he immediately turned back and rushed forward. The animals fled and fled again. There was only one innocent little lamb who had just been born. He was not afraid, and opened up with a pair of curious eyes, yelled at the tiger affectionately. This little guy regards the tiger as his own mother and wants to eat its milk. The tiger didn't understand what was going on. After a moment, he turned around and left. The animals who watched from a distance flocked up again, and surrounded the little warrior who was not afraid of the tiger, and sang praises to it. The tiger nodded and turned around and left.
