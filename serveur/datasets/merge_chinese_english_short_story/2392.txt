Six dolls, seven pits and a hot day, the seven little boys led by Vrancik came to the river. They built roads and built bunkers on the beach. Tired of playing, he fluttered and jumped into the river. They swam and barked in the river, and the white water splashed into a slice. Vrancik looked at his partner and counted one by one: "One, two, three ..." He clicked it several times, and only counted six. He panicked and said, "Hey! Who was submerged in the water? When we came there were seven, but now there are only six!" The children panicked and clicked a few. "Six! Only six!" They cried one after the other. Some of them used branches to fish in the river; others slammed into the river to touch them, yelling loudly, and making a mess. When Vrancik felt something in the water, he yelled: "Here! I'll catch him!" "Grasp him, don't let go!" The group yelled desperately to Vrancik Swim. At this time, Vranzik dragged a leather boot from the water. "Well, what can I do?" The children were so anxious that they were crying. There was an old man fishing near the river. He saw the children's confusion, heard the children's exclamation, and said to them, "Hurry up ashore. Everyone sit in a pit on the beach, and then count . "The children listened to the fisherman and went to the beach to sit in a pit. Vrancik ordered a few pits: "Seven! No more, no less, seven." At this time the children were all happy, jumping and jumping with joy. In this way, six children sat out of one pit with seven butts. Franzik looked at his partner and counted one by one: "One, two, three ..." He clicked it several times, and only counted six.
