The colorful swallows on the colorful bridge are going to the colorful bridge. It flies, flies, flies for three days and three nights, and never stops. It's windy and raining, it's not afraid, and it always flies forward. The wind stopped, the rain stopped, the sun showed a smile, and the colorful bridge appeared. Red, orange, yellow, green, green, blue, purple, what a beautiful colorful bridge! The little swallow cried happily.
