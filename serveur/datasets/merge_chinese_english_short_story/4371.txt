The grapes are grown in terraces on the hillside. The dense branches and leaves spread out in four directions, like setting up a green pergola. In autumn, bunches of grapes hang under bunches of green leaves. There are red, white, purple, dark red, light green, colorful, and beautiful. If you go to the Grape Valley at this time, the hospitable Uighur fellow will surely pick the sweetest grapes and let you eat enough.
