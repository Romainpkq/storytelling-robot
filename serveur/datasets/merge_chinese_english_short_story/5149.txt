My family lives in Xiaoshan Village. There is a fruit tree on the hillside. Full of pink peach, snowy pear flower. At the foot of the mountain there is a beautiful new house, that is our school. There is a small river in front of the school. The river is clear and clear, and sometimes you can see small fish swimming around. Looking up, the newly-built mountain road bends and stretches into the distance. I love my little mountain village, I love my hometown.
