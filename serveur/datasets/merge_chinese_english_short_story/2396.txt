Spring is here, the flowers are blooming, the grass is green, and the small trees are budding. The little horse came and stepped down the grass. The little bear came and shook the little tree. Here comes the little monkey, plucking the flowers. The flowers and trees cried and said, "We don't like such friends, please go away." The bird came, caught the bugs, the bees came, and passed pollen. Here comes the child, watering it. Flowers, trees and trees said with a smile: "We all like this kind of friend, you stay." Spring is here, the flowers are blooming, the grass is green, and the small trees are budding.
