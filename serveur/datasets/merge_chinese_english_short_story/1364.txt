Colorful Bridge Little Swallow is going to the Colorful Bridge. It flies, flies, flies for three days and nights, and never stops. It's windy and rainy, it's not afraid, it always keeps flying forward. The wind stopped, the rain stopped, the sun smiled, and the colorful bridge appeared. Red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, purple, what a colorful bridge! The little swallow cried happily. The wind stopped, the rain stopped, the sun smiled, and the colorful bridge appeared.
