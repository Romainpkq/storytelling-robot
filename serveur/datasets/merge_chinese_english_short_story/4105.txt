Azalea Sunday, I went for a walk in the park. I wandered to the flower garden, which was full of azaleas. It is our city flower in Wuxi, clumps of clumps, clumps of clumps, so well-opened! Some of these azaleas are double-petaled and some are single-petaled. The double-petalled flowers are overlapping and clustered together with a cluster of stamens in the middle. They drove in threes and fives in droves, as if what a close friend was talking about. Look, the single-petal flower is not bad either. Several petals surround it, both like stars and small trumpets. "Tick-tick" plays the hymn of spring. I couldn't help but stepped forward and smelled it, ah, the faint fragrances flew past the tip of my nose, intoxicating! I put the Buddha in the sea of ​​flowers. The little bee smelled the scent and flew to the flowers to sing a beautiful song; the little butterfly smelled the scent, climbed on the stamen, carrying a large bag of food, and went home happily ... The saying goes well, "Red flower "Let's have a green leaf lining." Pulling the petals apart, the green leaves are oval-shaped, like a green boat, touched by hand, furry, it is lined with flowers, flowers and leaves, it looks even more gorgeous.
