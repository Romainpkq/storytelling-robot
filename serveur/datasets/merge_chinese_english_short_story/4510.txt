Snowman "It's snowing! It's snowing!" Xiaohua took out the tool and rushed out of the yard with his friends in the same courtyard to pile up the snowman. Xiaohua first piled up a big snowball with a dustpan as a snowman's body. Xiaohong took out the bamboo pole and inserted it into the snowball. This is the hand. So the fat body was done. Xiaoli piled up a small head with a dustpan, and his eyes, nose, and hat were worse. By the way, the iron bucket can be used as a hat. Xiaogang took out two small round briquettes and a carrot from his home, pressed it on the snowman's face, and drew a curved line with his finger under the snowman's nose, ha! A snowman is piled up. The little friends all laughed with joy.
