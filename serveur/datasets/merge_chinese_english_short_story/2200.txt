The motherland 's mountains and rivers are beautiful and rumbling. The train is like a steed, and runs happily on the field. The car window is like a camera, taking photos of the event. One photo is the field. The fields are so big that they are too big to reach, and the roads divide the green fields into pieces. One photo is high mountains. The mountains are so high, so high, that they can't reach the top. There are mountains, holding hands, shoulder to shoulder. One photo is green water. The water surface is wide and wide, so wide that it cannot reach the shore. Rumble, Rumble. The train is like a horse, running happily on the field. The mountains and rivers can't be seen. The motherland is beautiful. The car window is like a camera, taking photos of the event.
