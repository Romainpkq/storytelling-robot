My favorite is rose flowers. The stems of rose flowers are thin and extremely long, and there are many small hard thorns on it. Touch it, and it will pierce you hard. The leaves of rose flowers are oval, with many small teeth on the sides. The most beautiful is that there are many colors of rose flowers, red, white, and yellow. Flowers of various colors are very beautiful when they bloom.
