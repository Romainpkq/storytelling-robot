The spring rain was "Xili, Xili, Xili ..." There was light rain in the sky, the thin and dense rain filaments, like a bright silver thread, floating down from the sky. The flower lifted up the shallow wine glass, covered with the bright raindrops, and tasted it, sweet and fragrant. The willow girl woke up and took a light raindrop on her head. Feng'er combed the green wicker like a comb, ha, the willow girl's long hair, so beautiful. Xili, Xili, Xili ... what a wonderful spring rain!
