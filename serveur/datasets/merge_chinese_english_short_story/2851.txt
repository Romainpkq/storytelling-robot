In the green vegetable field of snails and earthworms, a snail crawled by the corner of the wall. The earthworm saw it and asked, "Brother Snail, where are you going?" The snail said, "I'm going to the top of the wall to see what's in the distance." The earthworm laughed suddenly, "Huh! You also think of the top of the wall Go up? Do n’t imagine it! You crawl slowly! ”The snail ignored it. Slowly climbed up the wall. The earthworm thought the snail was too ridiculous, and went to sleep. The earthworm woke up. I can't see the snail anymore. It turned out that the snail had already climbed to the top of the wall. The earthworm woke up.
