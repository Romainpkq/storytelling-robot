The playful little squirrel managed to survive the winter. In the spring, he was having fun. Singing, dancing, hide-and-seek ... Summer is here, and he is still enjoying himself. One night, the woodpecker came knocking on the door. The little squirrel was too tired to play and slept well. The woodpecker knocked on the door for a long time to wake the little squirrel. The little squirrel opened the door, and the woodpecker politely said, "Excuse me, the rabbit asked me to drop a letter of urgency. I have to come knock on your door." The little squirrel thanked the woodpecker. He opened a letter stating a hundred thousand urgency with a feather in it. There was nothing in the envelope but a dead leaf in autumn. The little squirrel took a closer look. There was a small "?" On the right side of the dead leaves. The little squirrel blushed all the way to the neck. He couldn't help but remember the wolverine scene of borrowing food everywhere last fall and winter ... The little squirrel ripped off a half of the dead leaf with a question mark and attached it to the wall in the house. On the other half of the dead leaves, he drew a "!", Put it in an envelope, and inserted feathers. Please give it to the rabbit by the woodpecker. Early the next morning, the little squirrel was no longer playful, and he picked mushrooms and pine cones in the forest. He wants to store grain for the winter. One night, the woodpecker came knocking on the door. The little squirrel was too tired to play and slept well.
