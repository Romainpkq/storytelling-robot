The little monster who missed the spell learned a lot of spells from his father. He used spells to make gardens, castles, and gold and silver jewelry. Although the little monster can change a lot of things with spells, he is not happy at all, and there is no smile on his face. One day, for some reason, he missed the wrong spell and turned himself into a little bitch. The little monster limped along the forest while the little rabbit saw it and jumped all the way to help him pick up the things in his hand. The little monkey saw it and helped him down the high hillside. When the little lark saw it, he gave him many delicious fruits. When the little monsters said "thank you" to the little rabbit, the monkey, and the little lark, their faces all smiled sweetly. Xiao Jingwei then realized that the happiness was not hidden in his spell, but in the joy of helping others and accepting the help of others.
