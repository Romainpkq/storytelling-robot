Riding a bike I used to ride a four-wheeled stroller before, so I think a two-wheeled bike is also a piece of cake. I didn't wait for my mother to speak, I couldn't wait to get on the car, but I couldn't hold it and fell off. My mother laughed and said, "I can't eat hot tofu in a hurry, but I'll help you practice a few laps." After I learned the lesson, I carefully re-ride the car. I didn't wait for my mother to speak, I couldn't wait to get on the car, but I couldn't hold it and fell off.
