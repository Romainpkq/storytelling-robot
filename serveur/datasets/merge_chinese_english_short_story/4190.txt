There is a cute little white rabbit in our family. Its name is Bai Bai. The white rabbit's body is snow-white and snow-white, with long ears and short tail, and a pair of red eyes, like two big rubies, so cute. At ordinary times, it always loves to bounce, but as soon as I give it radish, he stops obediently, chewing its big radish with relish, without lifting his head, and the three-petal mouth keeps moving. Zizi is really interesting.
