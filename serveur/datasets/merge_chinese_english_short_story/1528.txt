How beautiful the world is. The hen squatted and hatched her chicks, squatting for many days. The chick in the eggshell was asleep first, but then it woke up and saw the yellow surrounding. The chick thought: The whole world is yellow! The chick pecked the eggshell with a small pointed beak. It pecked and pecked for a long time before it pecked out a small hole. It saw that the sky was blue and blue, the trees were green, the river was clear and clear ... the world is so beautiful! The chick is happy. As soon as it propped up with its wings, it broke the eggshell. It screamed stupidly and stood up slowly. Alas, alas, the chick was saying, "How beautiful the world is!-Lan Zhanzhan, Greenery, Bichengcheng ... Chicks peck the eggshells with their small pointed beaks."
