The big lion was tickling, so he called some small animals to scratch it. The little rabbit caught him, and the big lion said, "Light! Lightened!" , Angrily shouting. The fox found itchy and asked the big lion to grab it by himself. The big lion picked up the tickle and scratched it by himself. He wanted to grab it lightly and gently. When he wanted to grab it, he would grab it heavily. The more you grasp the more comfortable, the big lion laughs with joy.
