Happily, I love my school. There are teachers and classmates in the school. Everyone learns together and is affectionate. I love my school. There are classrooms and playgrounds in the school. Let's play together and have fun. I love my school. There are classrooms and playgrounds in the school. Let's play together and have fun.
