Peacock, myna and hen Once upon a time, there was a farmer who built a house in the woods, which was strong and spacious. The birds in the woods want to move into this house and live with the farmer. The peacock first ran to the farmer and said, "Let me live with you! I look the best, open my tail, and look as beautiful as flowers." Then, the myna came to the farmer and said, "Let me live with you Let's be together! My mouth is the most clever. Whatever you say, I will say what you want to hear. "At this moment, a hen came. The farmer asked the hen, "What's your skill?" The hen smiled and said, "I'm neither beautiful nor my mouth good. What I can do is lay eggs." The farmer listened to the hen and said: "A down-to-earth egg is more precious than playing with a hundred beautiful feathers and saying a thousand good words. Hard-working hens, you are welcome to live here." The peacock and myna listened to the farmer's words , Sorry to go. The birds in the woods want to move into this house and live with the farmer.
