Washing the handkerchief On Sunday, I saw that the handkerchief covering the phone was dirty, so I decided to wash it. I unscrewed the faucet, received a basin of fresh water, put the handkerchief into the water and soaked it, then hit soap on it, then rubbed it vigorously with both hands, and a lot of foam was rubbed. After rubbing it, I washed it with clean water several times and wringed the handkerchief dry. Take a look, ah! There is no stain on the handkerchief, just like the new one.
