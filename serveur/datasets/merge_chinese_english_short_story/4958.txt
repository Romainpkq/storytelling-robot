Opening up the earth It is said that a long time ago, the heaven and the earth were together. It was endless, and it looked like a big egg. In this "egg", Pangu, the ancestor of human beings, was born. One day, Pangu split the "egg" with his own axe. In this way, the light object rises into a high blue sky; the heavy one sinks into a vast earth. Pangu was afraid that the world and the world would join together, so he supported the world with his hands and feet. Slowly, the longer and higher the Pangu, the higher and higher the sky, and the thicker the ground. In the end, Pangu spent 18,000 years to complete the mission.
