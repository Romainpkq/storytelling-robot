There is a nest of ants under the sycamore tree in front of my house. The ants worked hard all day, and no one was lazy. They are also very united. When they meet, they shake their tentacles and say hello. I like them very much and sometimes catch them to eat them. The ants worked hard all day, and no one was lazy.
