The beautiful bear polluted the bear and planted a lot of flowers. The yard smelled fragrant. The puppy wanted to buy a pot, but the bear said, "My flowers are not for sale, I just give them away. Come to pick flowers on June 5!" On the 5th, the bear carried a pot of potted flowers onto a tricycle, and the wooden sign "Recycle used batteries and give you a pot of flowers" was inserted on it. The puppies understand that today is World Environment Day, and the bears are protecting the environment, and I want to participate. Jingle bells, tricycles crossing alleys, crossing the street, the puppy ran and shouted: "beautiful for pollution, flowers for waste batteries!" When the kittens and rabbits heard it, they went out, put down the waste batteries, and took away a pot of flowers. When Monkey Grandma arrived with a basket of used batteries, the flowers had already been delivered. Monkey Grandma smiled and said, "It doesn't matter. To care for the environment is to care for our lives." He ran and shouted: "A beautiful change of pollution, a fresh flower for a waste battery!
