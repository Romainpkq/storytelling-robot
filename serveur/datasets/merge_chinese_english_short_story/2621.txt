Who will lend the umbrella to the side of the road? There is a small and exquisite wooden house with colorful exterior walls that decorates the hut so beautifully. There is a helping cat in the cabin. One day, frogs, tortoises, ducklings, and big cocks went together to play on the street. On the way home, it was getting dark, and after a while, it rained heavily. Little cat is watching TV. It heard the raining sound of "rushing, rushing" outside, and thought, "Will there be a friend who needs an umbrella?" The little cat hurriedly took the little flower umbrella out of the door. It stood under the eaves and saw four little friends coming along the road from a distance. But now there is only one umbrella in my hand. Who is it lent to? The little cat sees the frog bouncing around, oh! It understood that the frog grew up in the river and was not afraid of rain. He saw the turtle stretch out its long neck and drank the rain happily, and there was a lid on its back. It turned out that the turtle didn't use an umbrella. It also saw the ducklings, which had shiny and smooth feathers. When the rain dripped on it, it slipped off, and it didn't even need an umbrella. There were only poor big cocks, and the thin feathers were soaked by the rain. The little cat quickly lent the small flower umbrella to the big cock! The little cat thinks that he has done a great thing and feels very happy in his heart! It understood that the frog grew up in the river and was not afraid of rain.
