The brave little rooster The little rooster comes to the grass with his mother every day. When he meets other little animals and bullies other chicks, he always rushes up bravely. One day a ferocious eagle flew over the grass. The mother chicken told the chicks to hide in the grass. The little cock wanted to rush up and drive away the eagle, and the mother chicken grabbed him. The little cock said to his mother with dissatisfaction: "I've grown up, I can drive the eagle away." The mother chicken said to him, "A person's ability is limited, and being brave is not enough. Dealing with the eagle, hard No way, it's also a good way to avoid him. "The little cock said to his mother with dissatisfaction," I've grown up, I can drive the eagle away.
