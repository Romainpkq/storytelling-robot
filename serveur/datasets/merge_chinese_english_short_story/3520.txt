The snowman stands alone in the field. The little rabbit, the little cat and the little dog came, and said to the snowman: "We are looking for spring, and when we find it, we must bring a gift to you." They walked and walked, they saw a bush of wildflowers, and the puppy picked one. They walked and saw a row of sprouting willow branches, and the puppy folded a branch. They walked and walked, and when they saw a group of little tadpoles, the kitten grabbed a bottle. They brought gifts to the snowman, but the snowman was gone.
