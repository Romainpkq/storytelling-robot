There is a little tiger in the forest than before, he thinks he is the king of the forest, he has the greatest ability, and he is proud all day long. The ostrich said dissatisfiedly: "Let's run than run." I saw the ostrich running towards the finish like an arrow. The little ostrich won in the cry of the little animals. The little tiger touched his head, and he could not believe that this was true. At this moment, the little monkey climbed down from the tree and said, "Let's compare it to climbing a tree?" In the cheering of the little animals, the little monkey climbed to the tree quickly. It also mischievously grimaced at the little tiger under the tree. The little tiger said angrily: "We are better than running and climbing trees, it is better than swimming." The animals came to the river, and the little fish said: "Let me compare with you." He lowered his head, sneaked away, and the animals smiled happily.
