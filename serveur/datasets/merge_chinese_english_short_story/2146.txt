On Sunday afternoon, I sat on the balcony and drew pictures. I first drew a forest on paper with a green watercolor pen. The forests are green and the trees are very dense. I painted a clear blue sky above the forest. There are still white clouds floating in the sky. Then I drew a few birds in the forest, yellow feathers, and pointed mouths, which were very interesting. In the end, I gave the picture a name: "Bird's Home". The forests are green and the trees are very dense.
