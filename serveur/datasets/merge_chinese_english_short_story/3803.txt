I think I want to become a leaf, falling down in autumn, like a butterfly. I want to become a candle, to bring light to people in the event of a power outage. I want to be a bed. When dad is very tired, let him lie down and rest on me. I want to be a lark. When mother is troubled, listen to her beautiful song.
