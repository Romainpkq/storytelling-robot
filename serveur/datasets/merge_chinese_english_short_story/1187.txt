Good neighbor bunny loves to jump and sing. These days, she does not jump or sing, walks softly, speaks softly. Mother Rabbit was so anxious that she thought the rabbit was ill and wanted to take her to the hospital for treatment. "No, I'm not sick." The rabbit quietly told her mother ... The goat father who was living downstairs was sick and was lying at home to rest. The bunny mother brought the little rabbit downstairs to see the goat father. The goat father got up and said with a smile: "My illness is much better. Thank you for your concern. You are really my good neighbors!" Good neighbors! The little rabbit listened and smiled sweetly. Mother Rabbit was so anxious that she thought the rabbit was ill and wanted to take her to the hospital for treatment.
