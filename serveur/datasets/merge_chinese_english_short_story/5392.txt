My little goldfish There are two little goldfish in my family. They are golden on their bodies. Two bulging eyes seem to be watching you every moment. They have a fan-like tail, which is always swayed in the water, and a belly like a ball, which eats a lot of food at once. They have a lot of fun in the water. I like them very much. The first thing I do every day when I come back is to feed them.
