Little white rabbit Little white rabbit's eyes are red, like two shiny rubies; the ears are long, they will turn; the tail is short, and it is tilted upward. It has short front legs and long hind legs, and it jumps up and down. It is covered with snow-white hair and looks from a distance, like a ball of white fluffy beating, very cute.
