Good friends of crops-there are many kinds of frogs. A common species is the black spotted frog, which can reach 8 cm; the back is green with black markings; the abdomen is as white as snow; the head is slightly triangular; there are a pair of protruding eyes on both sides of the head, and the vision is very sharp and can quickly detect flying Insects, but they are not sensitive to the lying insects. There is a movable tongue in the mouth of the frog. During predation, the tongue quickly traverses the exit, sticks the bug, and is caught in the mouth, often with a hundred hairs. The main food of frogs is agricultural pests such as moths, mosquitoes, flies and rice planthoppers. Therefore, frogs are known as good friends of crops.
