Where is the wind? The wind is in the sky. You see, it blew clouds and ran forward, like a sailboat sailing on the sea. Where is the wind? The wind is on the willow. You see, it is blowing wicker gently, like children dancing. Where is the wind? The wind is on the water. You see, the sparkling waves it blows, and the duckweed on the water is shaking. Where is the wind? what ! The wind is in my hand. I waved the air, and the wind came.
