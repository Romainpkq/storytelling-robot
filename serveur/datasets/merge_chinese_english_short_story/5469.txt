It took one year for Russian writer Gorky to recuperate on an island in Italy. His ten-year-old son followed his mother to visit his father. The son planted many flowers in the yard where his father lived. Soon, he followed his mother back home. In spring, the flowers germinate and grow leaves, and soon the flowers are all blooming. Gorky looked at the blooming flowers under the window, and was very happy. He wrote a letter to his son, which means something like this: You left, but the flowers you planted stayed. Looking at them, I thought in my heart: My good son left a beautiful thing on the island-flowers. If you leave people with beautiful things no matter when and where, like flowers, good thoughts, and very good memories of you, how happy your life should be! At that time, you will feel that all people need you. You know, "giving" is always more enjoyable than "taking".
