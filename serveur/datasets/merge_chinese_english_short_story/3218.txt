Our dense mountain forest is the home of the little birds, and the little birds are singing in the mountain forest. The clear river is the fish's home, and the fish are playing in the river. The vast grassland is the home of cattle and sheep. The cattle and sheep run freely on the grassland. The rich earth is our home, and we thrive on it. Love our home, love their home, and make all homes beautiful and picturesque!
