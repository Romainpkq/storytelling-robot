Hyacinth This is a small flower with a unique style. It looks a little like a narcissus, but its flowers and stems are purple. I can't figure out why it is called "hyacinth": Is it the wind girl who awakened it, then it blooms small flowers and conveys the message of spring to people?

When flowers and leaves need nutrition, their roots are reserved for them. The newborn leaves spread out all around. As soon as spring comes, hyacinths bloom in order from the bottom up, as if telling people: "Spring is here! Spring is here!" Hyacinth is so beautiful, I love hyacinth! The roots of hyacinths grow in water and are entangled together playfully like bean sprouts;
