Grandpa Deng Xiaoping's tree planting festival in 1985 was an unforgettable day. On this day, there were no clouds in the world, and the spring breeze was blowing. Among the crowd planting trees in the Temple of Heaven Park, 81-year-old grandfather Deng Xiaoping was particularly striking. I saw that he was digging a tree pit with a shovel in his hand, and his forehead was covered with beads of sweat, and he still refused to rest. A tree pit was dug up. Grandpa Deng picked a vigorous cypress seedling and carefully moved it into the tree pit. He waved a shovel and filled a few shovels of soil. He stood a few steps away and took a closer look. He did n’t feel very straight, and said repeatedly, “No, no!” He stepped forward and planted the sapling on a green cypress tree, standing straight like a warrior There. There was a satisfied smile on Grandpa Deng 's face. Today, the cypress trees planted by Grandpa Deng personally have grown up, and the "Xiaoping Tree" has become a beautiful scenery in the Temple of Heaven.
