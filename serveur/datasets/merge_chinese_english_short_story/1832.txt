I gave my grandmother a four year old deer is a lovely child. In the morning, she saw the sun coming in from the east window, shining brightly across the room. The deer came to the grass, the golden sun shone on the earth, the purple wild flowers were fragrant, and the "cricket" bird sang cheerfully. Deer thought happily: ah, what a great sunshine, I will take it back as a gift to grandma! Deer wrapped the sunlight tightly in his apron and went home. Lu'er's grandma's legs were broken and she couldn't leave the house. She always said: "How much I want to see the sunshine!" Luer ran to the grandma's room as soon as she came home and called: "Grandma, I will bring you a present Now, look, this is the sun! "Luer said as he unrolled the apron and saw, the sun in the apron was gone. Luer pouted his mouth, and said unhappyly, "Why is it gone? Where did you go?" Grandma looked at Luer's expression and said happily, "It doesn't matter. My good baby, the sun is running Go to your heart. Grandma has received your gift. "Luer wrapped the sunlight tightly in his apron and went home.
