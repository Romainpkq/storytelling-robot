Listen Close your eyes and listen to the sound of the spring playing the piano. Close your eyes and listen to the sound of Baiyun's boating. Close your eyes and listen to the sound of the dew rolling over the heel. Close your eyes and listen to the sound of lotus leaves walking. Close your eyes and listen to the sound of the sun's anger. Close your eyes and listen to the blushing sound of maple leaves. Close your eyes and listen to the sound of orange lighting. Close your eyes and listen to the sound of summer saying goodbye to us. Listen Close your eyes and listen to the sound of the spring playing the piano.
