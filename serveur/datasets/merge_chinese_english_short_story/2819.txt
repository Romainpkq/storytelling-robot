Little "Jimmy" I like to walk. I have eaten dinner every day. I love to walk at my doorstep. Every time I take a walk recently, I always see a little white and white dog. The owner often calls it "Jimmy". The little "Jimmy" has aura. Every time I see me, I always look excited, as if I saw an old friend, playfully turn around me, and often raise my front paw to say hello to me. As long as I squat down and gently stroke its soft fine hairs, it will lie there motionlessly and look so docile. Little "Jimmy" When he heard the master 's shout, he would immediately jump up and return obediently to the master. I have always loved dogs, but since I met the little "Jimmy", I really want to own such a little dog too!
