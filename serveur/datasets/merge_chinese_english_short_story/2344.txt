The small river in the east of my village There is a small crooked river in the east of the village. The water is clear to the end. Fishes swim freely in the river, and from time to time there are a few small fishes jumping out of the water. The river bank was covered with flowers. Bees fly around in the flowers. Several butterflies danced beautifully on the flowers. The west bank of the river is a row of tall and erect poplars, and the birds are singing cheerfully on the branches. After school, children often come here to play. Some catch fish, some catch butterflies, and some collect wild flowers. This small river has become a paradise for the children of our village.
