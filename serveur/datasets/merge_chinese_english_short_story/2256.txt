Yeti stands alone in the field. The little rabbit, little cat and little dog came, and said to the snowman, "We are looking for spring. When we find it, we must bring a gift to you." They walked and walked, and when they saw a row of budding willow branches, the puppy broke a branch. They walked and walked, and when they saw a bunch of tadpoles, the kittens took a bottle. They came to find the snowman with gifts, but the snowman was gone. Yeti stands alone in the field.
