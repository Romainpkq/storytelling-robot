Forest, hello one tree, two trees, many, many trees. Holding hands, side by side, a green sea. Hello, big green forest! Hello, big green forest! The little bird said, "The forest is the home of the green umbrella." The little deer said, "The forest is a tent, and it is my home." Hello, big green forest! The sand said, "The forest is a wall, so let's not run wildly." The rain said, the forest is a reservoir, let me stay! The sand said, "The forest is a wall, so let's not run wildly."
