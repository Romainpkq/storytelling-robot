The blind and the mule Once upon a time, there was a blind and a mule in a room. One day, the house caught fire, and when they saw that they were about to be buried in the sea of ​​fire, the sister-in-law was very anxious, but the legs did not listen. The blind man said, "Don't worry, as long as my legs and your eyes are together, will we not be the same as normal people?" Xunzi was very happy when she heard it. So the blind man carried the mule, and the mule gave him directions on the blind's back. They calmly walked out of the sea of ​​fire and escaped this disaster safely.
