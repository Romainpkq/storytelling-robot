Happy Grass Boy Jimmy 's mother has a farm, but Jimmy can't help her with some farm work. Because Jimmy is also very busy, he is busy looking for a kind of happy grass for his mother. That day, Jimmy met a rabbit. After listening to Jimmy's plan, the rabbit said, "Don't look for this kind of grass. We eat this grass every day, but it doesn't bring us a sense of happiness. Help your mother to do more farm work That way, you will be happy. "Jimmy thought the rabbit made sense, so he returned to his mother's farm to help his mother. Not only did Jimmy learn to weed on the farm, he also learned to raise sheep and grow vegetables. Jimmy 's mother said to Jimmy, "My child, my mother is so happy with you!" Jimmy smiled embarrassedly. He only knew now that happiness has always been in his heart. After listening to Jimmy's plan, the rabbit said, "Don't look for this kind of grass. We eat this grass every day, but it doesn't bring us a sense of happiness. Help your mother to do more farm work. That way, you will be happy.
