The little pig was envious when he saw the ducks playing on the water. At this time, a frog was swimming happily in the water, and the pig saw and said, "Haha, swimming is too easy." All of a sudden, he jumped into the water. No matter how the hands and feet move in the water, the pig sinks straight down and drank a belly. Otherwise, the eldest brother Buffalo rescued him in time, I am afraid it would have been dead.
