The peach blossoms bloom in the spring of all seasons, and bees and butterflies all fly. In the summer the lotus blooms and the fish in the pond swims over. Chrysanthemums bloom in autumn, and the swallows fly away and the leaves fall. In winter, plum blossoms bloom and silver snowflakes fall. Flowers bloom all year round, and happiness makes people happy.
