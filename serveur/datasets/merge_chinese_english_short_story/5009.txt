The little squirrel put on a thick leather jacket to prepare for the winter. When it saw the sycamore tree shaking, the yellow leaves fell down, and asked anxiously: "Daddy sycamore tree, it's cold, why don't you grow a lot of leaves, but the leaves fall off, the whole body is bare, isn't it cold in winter? "The phoenix tree laughed and said," Good boy, I dropped the leaves just for winter! "The little squirrel asked in surprise:" So, the leaves grow because of the fear of heat? "" No, spring, summer The leaves help me grow taller, which is very important! "" Then ... "Little squirrel doesn't know what to say. The sycamore tree laughed again: "It is a big deal for us to drop leaves. The leaves can distribute moisture. The leaves are dry in the fall. The roots drink less water. As soon as the leaves radiate, we will die if we lack water. You can spend the winter better. "
