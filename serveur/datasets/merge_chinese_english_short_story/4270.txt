Mother, why Xiaohe laughs loudly because the sun tickles her and tickles her. Mom, why is Hehe singing because the lark is praising her babble. Mother, why is Xiaohe so cool because she is immersed in the reverie that is deeply loved by snow. Mom, how old is Xiaohe, she will always be the same age as the young spring. Mom, why doesn't Xiaohe rest because her mother, the sea, hopes her at all times.
