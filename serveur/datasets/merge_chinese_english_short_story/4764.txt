The lively forest is in the big forest, the big cock and the little yellow warbler always get up early. You listen to "Oh ..." The big cock is using its bright voice to make people wake up early! The little yellow warbler is not willing to sing behind the "chirp". Look over there, the little white rabbit and the little gray rabbit have already started their work for a day. They are working together to build a beautiful new house. Listen to "Ding Ding Dang Dang ..." This is the little gray rabbit moving bricks fast! Look, how powerful they are! Look here, the frog and the duck "slammed" into the clear lotus pond and started the swimming competition. You chased me and it was very intense. Hey, what about the monkeys and bears? They were breathless and sweat "tick ticked" down, in a hurry. It turned out that they were rushing to school. A variety of stories are happening in the big forest every day, every day is lively and full of joy!
