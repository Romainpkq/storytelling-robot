The mountains and rivers of the motherland are beautiful and rumbling. The train is like a horse, running happily on the field. The car window is like a camera, taking pictures of the event. One photo is the field. The fields are so big and so big that they are too big to be seen. The roads divide the green fields into pieces. A photo is of high mountains. The mountains are high and high, so high that they can't reach the top, mountains and mountains, holding hands, shoulder to shoulder. A picture is of green water. The water surface is so wide and wide that it is too wide to reach the shore. The fishing boats are scattered and the fishermen cast nets to fish. Rumble, Rumble. The train is like a horse, running happily in the field, the mountains and rivers can not be seen, and the motherland is very beautiful.
