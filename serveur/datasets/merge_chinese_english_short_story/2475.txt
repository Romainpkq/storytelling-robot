The shadow is before, and the shadow is behind. The shadow always follows me, like a little black dog. The shadow is on the left and the shadow is on the right. The shadow is always with me. It is my good friend. The shadow is on the left and the shadow is on the right. The shadow is always with me. It is my good friend.
