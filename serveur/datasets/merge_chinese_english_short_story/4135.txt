June 1st is Children's Day. On this day, the colorful flags fluttered on the campus, and the children's faces were full of joy, and they came to the school with great joy. The celebration began. Many factories and neighborhood committees gave us many gifts, including toys, chess pieces, books, and small footballs. The students sang, danced, performed martial arts, and performed tricks, and performed wonderful programs. At the celebration, all our first grade children wore red scarves. The teacher told us that the young pioneers should win glory for the red scarf and be the little master of the motherland. I must remember what the teacher said.
