Tonight in the moonlight, I am very comfortable. After dinner, I lay quietly on the chair on the balcony, enjoying the beautiful moonlight while cooling off. In the soft moonlight, the river that ran for a day subsided. The moon was reflected on the river, and the evening wind blew, sparkling, like a ribbon of jewels. The moonlight enveloped the earth like smoke and mist. Yue'er is a kind and most affectionate girl. Whoever has sorrow, he will look at you with pity and share your worries for you, even pulling a half of the white cloud to cover the crying face. Yue'er is also a happy and cheerful girl. She hides in the white clouds to hide and seek with the stars, and sometimes tells stories to the stars. The stars can hear their eyes blinking. I like the moonlight in the night sky.
