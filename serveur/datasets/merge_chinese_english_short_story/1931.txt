The little girl who catches the sea "The soft beach, the golden yellow sand, the little girl who catches the sea bare feet ..." Before, while listening to this song, I dreamed that I could be the little girl who catches the sea. Today, my wish has finally come true. Now I am standing on the beach. I came to the beach with my bare feet. The sea is not the turquoise blue, but the gray blue. But the waves of waves still excite me. I came to the beach and walked slowly on the edge of the waves. The naughty waves hit my feet, gently, softly, and extremely comfortable. Later, I became bolder and went to a slightly deeper sea. At this time, the spray is no longer a naughty child, but a troublemaker. Every time the waves came, I jumped and jumped, but every time the waves came in close contact with my clothes. Alas, the little girl catching the sea had to become a "chicken". At this time, the spray is no longer a naughty child, but a troublemaker.
