The shadow of a duck catching a fish crescent flashes in the water. When the little duck saw it, he thought it was a fish, and hurried to catch it. But it couldn't catch it. It understood, this is the shadow of the crescent moon, not a fish. After a while, a fish came over. The little duck thought: This must be the shadow of the crescent again, but don't be fooled again. It didn't catch it and turned its tail away. In this way, the duckling freed a fish. It understood, this is the shadow of the crescent moon, not a fish.
