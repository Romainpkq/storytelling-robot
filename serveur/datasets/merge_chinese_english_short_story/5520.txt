Who will lend the umbrella to the side of the road? There is a small and exquisite wooden house with colorful outer walls that decorates the hut beautifully and brightly. In the wooden house is a small cat that helps others. One day, frogs, turtles, ducks, and roosters went to the streets to play together. On the way home, the sky darkened, and after a while, it began to rain heavily. The little cat is watching TV. It heard the sound of raining outside, "Wow, Wow", and thought, "Will there be friends who need umbrellas?" The little cat quickly took the little umbrella and walked out the door. It stood under the eaves, and saw four little friends coming along the road from afar. But now there is only one umbrella in hand, to whom do you lend it? The little cat saw the frog walking up and down, oh! It understands that frogs grow up in rivers and are not afraid of rain. It saw the tortoise sticking out its long neck and drinking the rain happily. There was a lid on its back. The turtle did not use an umbrella. It also saw a little duck with shiny, smooth feathers. When the rain dropped on it, it slipped off, and it didn't need an umbrella. Only the poor big cock, the thin feathers were soaked in the rain, the little cat quickly lent the little cock to the big cock! The little cat thinks that he has done a big thing and feels so happy in his heart!
