On the way home from school, I found an injured bird. Looking at its pitiful appearance, he took it home. This little bird has a long, pointed mouth with a small amount of red hair on its head. The feathers on the back and tail are black, and the feathers on the abdomen are gray. It looks good! Mother came back from work and saw the bird, and happily told me, "This is a woodpecker. It can prey on pests in tree holes. People call it" Dr. Tree. "" I heard it and thought, "It turns out Only beneficial bird! After I have taken care of its wounds, I must send it back to nature and let it continue to heal the trees. "
