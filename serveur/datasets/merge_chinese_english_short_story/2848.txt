The roads in Qingdao, like the waves of the sea, will be low for a while and high for a while. I walk on the road. When I went uphill, I shouted, "Come on! Come on!" When I went downhill, as if the windy grandfather was pushing behind me, I shouted, "Dash!" Look, the car is driving far away. Bumps in the waves. The road in Qingdao is like the waves of the sea, one volt together, the other is a volt ... The road in Qingdao, like the waves of the sea, is low for a while and high for a while.
