Mid-autumn moon The mid-autumn moon is round. Mom said, "The round moon is like a plate." Dad said, "The round moon is like a flying saucer, with a group of small stars behind its tail." I said, "No, no! The moon is like a big moon cake, very delicious, It ’s very sweet, and I ’ll share it with you. ”The moon heard me, thinking it would be eaten, and rushed into the clouds. After a while, it knew that we were eating moon cakes, so it came out again and hung brightly in the sky.
