Girl and Mirror There is a girl named Xiaohua, wearing a floral skirt, wearing a braid, facing the large mirror, and asked, "What do I look like?" On the willow tree outside the window, there was a flower magpie, rushing to answer: " Twitter, his face is like a flower! "Xiaohua listened and smiled. On the poplar outside the door, a black crow interjected and said, "Ah, my face looks like a winter melon!" Xiaohua heard it and cried. My mother saw it and said with a smile: "Stupid boy, don't love to listen to the good words of magpies, and don't be afraid to listen to the bad words of crows. To know how you look, you should ask the mirror and ask it to tell you the truth."
