The flowers of the four seasons in spring, the spring flowers blowing small brass, the peach flowers show a pink smile, the pear flowers are white like snow ... In the summer, the lotus flowers hold a small green umbrella, the pomegranate flowers ignite a bunch of flames, and the canna is a small yellow bow Girl ... In the autumn, the fragrance of osmanthus fragrant, drilled into the nose from far away; chrysanthemum unfolds golden petals; a bunch of red is a bunch of sugar gourds of autumn wind dolls ... are there any flowers in winter? In the cold wind, in the blizzard, you see, plum blossoms are blooming!
