The wall was "sweating". This morning, I just got up and suddenly found that the wall of my house was wet. A closer look showed that the walls were covered with small drops of water! Where did these little waterdrops come from? Do the walls also sweat? I felt very strange, so I went to ask my mother. My mother told me, "It's called the wall is still wet because the weather is sultry and the air is humid. It's going to rain soon." I quickly looked at the sky through the window: the sky was gray, the sun lost its former power, and the sun was not so dazzling. However, there is no dark cloud in the sky, how could it rain? The weather continued for two or three days, and it rained. I finally understood: the wall "sweating", it will rain. Haha, the wall has become a weather forecaster!
