The little white rabbit has no clock and does not know the time. It asks the little goat to help him find a way. The little goat gave him three potted flowers. The sun came out, the morning glory bloomed, and the small trumpet opened. At noon, the flower bloomed at noon, and a smile opened. It was dark, and the incense opened at night, with a small mouth opened to sing gently.
