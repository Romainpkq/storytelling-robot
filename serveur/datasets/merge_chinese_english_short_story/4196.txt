It rained a little, the sky was overcast, the clouds were low, and the sun was hiding. The swallows swept over the treetops, the fish jumped out of the water, and the ants whispered, whispering: "Let's light rain, it's going to rain! Quickly move! Quickly move!" Soon, ticking, ticking ... The little rain fell! It fell on the ground like knocking a snare drum; it fell in the pond and made the pool water laugh with flowers. Looking up at the sky, the little raindrops were connected into a line of silver, which was skewed by the wind, like a drunk drunk, like dancing. After a while, wow, wow, wow ... the little raindrops will gather together, become a stream, and flow on the ground. She washed the stone steps, washed the playground, and the asphalt roads became smooth and shiny. We are not afraid of rain, bare head, bare feet, running after Yuhua. Some carried sandals, some wore raincoats, some waved sticks, like a bunch of little ducks ... In the rain, we went to school.
