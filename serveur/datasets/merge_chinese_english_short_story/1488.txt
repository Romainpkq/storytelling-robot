In ancient China, there was a beast called "year". It has long tentacles and is fiercely abnormal. Every new year's eve it comes out to devour livestock and hurt people's lives. People are very afraid. Later, a fairy told people that sticking red paper on doors and windows and setting off firecrackers would scare away "years." On New Year's Eve, people did what the fairy said, and it really scared them away. Since then, every year on New Year's Eve, every family posted red couplets, set off firecrackers, and the households were brightly lit and stayed up late to guard the age. In the early morning of the first day of the first year, I still have to go to visit relatives and friends. These customs have spread widely and the year has also become the most solemn traditional festival of Chinese folk. On New Year's Eve, people did what the fairy said, and it really scared them away.
