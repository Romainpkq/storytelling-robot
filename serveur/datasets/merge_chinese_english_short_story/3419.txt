There is a crescent creek in front of our village. In the spring, the ice and snow in the river melted, and the river flowed slowly around the village. There is a stone bridge over the river. Weeping willows by the river spit out tender green buds, and pink peach blossoms protruded from the branches. Swarms of small fish swim around in the river. After school, we came to the river and sang and danced, not to mention how happy we were.
