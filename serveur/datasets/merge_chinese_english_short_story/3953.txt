The Little Zoo The little zoo has camels, rabbits, dogs, deer, and goats, etc. I like the goats in it the most. When I came to the zoo, I first ran to the lamb fold and took out the grass that I had prepared in advance. At this moment, a goat ran over. It has white hair, smooth and beautiful, with a pair of small horns on its head, a pair of round black eyes embedded in its exquisite face, and a pair of white beards under its small mouth, running, "bleating" while running Shouted.
