The ants and tadpoles are really hot in summer, and a group of ants are moving food. Some of them have sweats on their backs and pulls. When several crickets saw it, they all laughed. The ant was a fool. They hid under the big tree to enjoy the cool, some sing, some sleep, and all were free. When winter is here, the northwest wind blows whistling, and the ants lie in a hole full of grain for the winter. You are cold and hungry, and you don't look good anymore.
