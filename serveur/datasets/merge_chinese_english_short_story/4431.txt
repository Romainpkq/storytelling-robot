Promise to the stars The stars have their small eyes open and hung on the black velvet, sparkling, do you look down from above to see if I am pure? The stars with their small eyes open, shining in the tranquil sky, you are in the high places, saying I am kind? The stars have their small eyes open and their eyelashes blink more than once. Why do you have so many colors, blue, red, and purple? Curious little eyes, open all night without sleeping, rosy dawn, why wipe you out? The little eyes of the stars shed tears or dewdrops. You are shaking all the time, is it because of the cold? The little eyes of the stars, I assure you: you look at me, I will always be innocent.
