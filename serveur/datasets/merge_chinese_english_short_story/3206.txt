What are they doing in winter? The little monkey climbs the pine tree and finds squirrels to play with. The squirrel said, "I eat some dried mushrooms, and then go to sleep. I have been sleeping for a winter." The little monkey saw a honeycomb hanging in the bush, and he went to find a little bee to play with. The little bee said: "There is no nectar to pick in winter. I will sleep in the hive until next spring." The little monkey saw a wooden sign at the entrance of the dirt beside the dry grass, which read: "I slept in my house for a winter , Please do n’t disturb me—badger. ”There was a cave in the woods. The monkey saw how many bats in it grabbed the stone joints with his paws. His body hung upside down and slept soundly! The little monkey had to climb the tree by himself, grab the branch and hit the swing.
