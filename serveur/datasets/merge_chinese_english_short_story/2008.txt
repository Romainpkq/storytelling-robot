Mishutka and Stasik sat on a bench in a small garden and chatted. They are different from other children in chatting, and they talk about big talk and falsehood, as if they are the most bizarre to see who is speaking. "How old are you?" Mishutka asked. "Ninety-five. What about you?" "I'm 140 years old." Mishutka said, "Do you know, I used to be as tall as Uncle Boria, but only later became so short? Now, Stasik said immediately, "Then I changed from a child to an adult, and then to a child, and I will become an adult later." "I was able to swim across the river." Misut Card added. "Huh, you can swim across the river, I can swim across the sea." "What's so amazing about the sea! I can swim across the ocean!" "I used to fly!" "Don't brag, you fly me "" Not now, I forgot how to fly. "" What's so amazing about the sea! "
