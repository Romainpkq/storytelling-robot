Multi-functional bridge I am a bridge engineer. I designed a multi-functional bridge. It can move, it will lengthen and shorten, it will rise and fall. When there is heavy water, I can build this bridge on the water at any time. If the river rises again, the bridge I designed will also rise, and it will not affect the vehicles driving on the bridge. If the river recedes, I will lower the bridge, shorten it, and transport it back to the warehouse.
