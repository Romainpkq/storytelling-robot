Xiaohou called and installed a phone at Xiaohou's house. He thought: Now it's really convenient to invite a friend to be a guest at home. He picked up the phone on the table and started dialing. First he dialed the phone number of the little white rabbit's house. After he connected it, he said, "Hey, is it the home of the three petal mouth?" He called Piggy's house again: "Is it a fat ball player?" Piggy ignored him. When the monkey mother saw it, she said to the little monkey: "You are too impolite to call. You don't know how to respect others. Why would anyone come to be a guest?" The little monkey listened and bowed his head in shame.
