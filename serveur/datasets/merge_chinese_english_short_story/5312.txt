At naughty summer and summer noon, the sun is like a big fireball, hot and hot. The little flower is listless and sad. The grass has also dried up, and the leaves are all rolled up. The road seemed to be covered in a hot coat. The bicycle was parked outside, so hot that the owner dared not even sit. Ugh ! Summer, you are so naughty!
