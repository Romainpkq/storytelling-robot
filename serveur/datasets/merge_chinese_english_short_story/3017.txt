Help the grandmother find the needle one evening. The grandmother sat on the chair and sewed the clothes carefully. Accidentally, a needle placed on the needle box by the grandmother rolled under the chair. My grandmother asked me to find the needle, but I didn't find it for a long time. My grandmother said, "Forget it, forget it. I won't find it. I'll get another one." Suddenly, I thought of a magnet in the pencil case. So, I said to my grandmother: "Grandma, I have a way, I will find the needle." I took the magnet in my hand and looked in the direction of the lost needle. "Ha ha! I finally found it!" I am a smart boy. I think: I can use the knowledge I have learned to do something for adults.
