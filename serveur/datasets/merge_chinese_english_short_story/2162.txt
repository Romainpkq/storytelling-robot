Why is the South Pole colder than the North Pole? The South Pole and the North Pole are both poles on the earth with the same height and height. They are exposed to the sun at the same time and angle, but the South Pole is much colder than the North Pole. The average minimum temperature difference between the two places is 30 Â° C. Why is this ? It turns out that the Arctic Ocean takes up a large area in the Arctic. Water has a large heat capacity and can absorb more heat and then slowly dissipate it, so the winter in the Arctic should be warmer. The Antarctic region is a continent. The land's heat storage capacity is not strong. The heat absorbed in summer is quickly lost, so it will be very cold in winter. Why is the South Pole colder than the North Pole?
