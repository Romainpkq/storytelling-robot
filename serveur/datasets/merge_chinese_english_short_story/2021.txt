Little goldfish There are three little goldfishes in my family. They are all different and have their own characteristics. I also gave them names, such as the smallest one called "Little Little". It has two colors on its body: red and white. Its mouths are closed one by one and it keeps blowing bubbles. what ! It doesn't need bubble water! The goldfish's ears are so small that they can hardly be seen. Look at the tail of "little little", swing it back and forth, shake it back and forth. "Well, doesn't it sleep?" You ask. No, it sleeps, but it has no eyelids, and can only sleep with its eyes open. Little goldfish is usually slow-moving, but sometimes it can be very fast. For example, once you hit the fish tank, the small goldfish will quickly swim to the bottom of the water. Little goldfish eating is fun! Put the fish food into the water, and the small goldfish will swim quickly and open its mouth to eat. If the fish food is "blowing" bubbles in the mouth, the fish food will fall out of its mouth, but the small goldfish will still swallow half of the fish food. I like little goldfish very much. Put the fish food into the water, and the small goldfish will swim quickly and open its mouth to eat.
