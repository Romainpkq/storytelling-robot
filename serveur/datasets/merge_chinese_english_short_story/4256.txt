Sun Moon Lake is a beautiful big lake in the middle of Taiwan Province of China. There is an island in the Sun Moon Lake that divides the lake into two halves. One side of the pool is like a round sun, called "Sun Lake"; the other side is like a crooked moon, called "Moon Lake." The two lakes and lakes are connected, like a green jade plate. The island is like a pearl in a jade plate. The Sun Moon Lake is surrounded by mountains, and the mountains are densely wooded. The water at Sun Moon Lake is deep. The mountains and forests are reflected in the lake, the lakes and mountains are beautiful, and they are very beautiful. I love the beautiful Sun Moon Lake, and I love the island of Taiwan in the motherland.
