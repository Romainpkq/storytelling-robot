Mama Fish and her children are in a stream and live with Mama Fish and her children. The little fish always wanted to leave his mother and go around, but whenever he left, his mother always followed him. One day, the little fish plunged into the grass under the water while her mother wasn't paying attention. However, when he looked up at the water, he saw his mother swimming towards him. The little fish hurried into the crack of the stone again, but his mother still found him. The little fish was angry, and he shouted at his mother loudly: "Mom really hates it and follows me like a tail." Mommy smiled, and she didn't criticize the little fish. At this moment, a crooked pink thing dangled from the water surface, and a thin transparent line was tied on it. The little fish was so happy that he thought it was a sweet and sweet snack. He was about to go and eat, and only heard his mother yell, "Danger!" The little fish was startled, and he carefully looked at the "dim sum". It turned out that the pink thing was a piece of earthworm, which was strung by a bent needle. If it wasn't for the mother to stop in time just now, maybe you are already the booty of a fisherman. At this point, Xiaoyuer finally understood why her mother always kept behind her. However, when he looked up at the water, he saw his mother swimming towards him.
