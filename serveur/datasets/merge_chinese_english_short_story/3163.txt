Who is the smartest? There is a king who gives each of the three sons a coin. It is required to fill a room with the things bought. The eldest son bought a cart of wheat straw, which did not fill the room. The second son bought a bag of yellow sand and spread it on the ground, which could only cover the floor of the room. The third son bought a candle, and the lit candle lit the whole room. You say, who is the smartest?
