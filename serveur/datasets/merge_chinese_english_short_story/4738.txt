The fox and the crane turned out to be good friends. One day, the fox enthusiastically invited the crane to dinner. It served some soup on the plate and said, "Please eat." But nothing was eaten. A few days later, the crane also invited the fox to eat. He brought a narrow mouth and said, "Please eat." The fox smelled the fragrant smell. Arrived, had to go home on an empty stomach. The wise crane returned the hypocritical fox in the same way.
