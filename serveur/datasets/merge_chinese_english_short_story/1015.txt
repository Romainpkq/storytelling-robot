Oranges Today, Dad bought a basket of oranges from the fruit store. I took one and took a closer look. Oranges are oblate and the size of my fist. The skin is orange. It has a skin, but it looks like a small lantern from a distance. Peeling the orange peel, a peculiar fragrance of oranges comes out. The orange skin is white, like the orange gauze covered with orange petals. The orange petals are crescent-shaped, like a crooked moon, and many orange petals sit together around several good brothers. Put a flap into your mouth, the juice overflows, nourishes the throat, flows into the belly, and sweetens the heart, making people eat more and more. Oranges are oblate and the size of my fist. The skin is orange.
