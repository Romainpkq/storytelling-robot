In the morning of the sun in the fog, as soon as I got up, I hurried to the balcony. Yeah! The fog was so thick, the thick fog of the sky made the earth hazy and dim. It took a while before the eastern sun rose slowly. The sun that just came out was like a big fireball, and it didn't shine at all. The fog slowly rises in the sun, rises, and gradually dissipates. The sun slowly rises and rises, the sun shines on the ground, and the dew on the grass leaves glitters like pearls. The sun emits thousands of rays, so that the white clouds floating in mid-air become golden and bright in time. After a while, it was dyed rosy again. To the east, half of the sky is red. The scenery is very beautiful. The sun slowly rises and rises, the sun shines on the ground, and the dew on the grass leaves glitters like pearls.
