There is a little cat in my house. It is covered with long hairs. It is so beautiful that it is black and white. It has round eyes, like a glass ball, and emits green light at night. The little cat's ears are very sensitive. With a little sound, the ears immediately rise. It also has a furry tail, and when it's happy, it swings left and right, like a flower stick. The scent of the cat's nose is very sensitive. It smells a little fishy all the way, and it can also smell. It has five small meat pads on its feet, soft like a quilt, and it walks quietly without any sound. My little cat is so cute. The little cat's ears are very sensitive. With a little sound, the ears immediately rise.
