Encounter of a monkey A monkey cleverly climbed to a tree, and the animals under the tree began to make all kinds of comments. The rabbit said, "It's ugly to look at the monkey's tail, like a dead branch!" The weasel said, "Look at the monkey's butt, like two red sores, it's disgusting!" The dog said, "The monkey is so thin and the tree climbs so Quickly, it must be an expert at stealing things. "At this time, the goat said to the animals who spoke," Monkeys are very good at climbing trees! You don't climb trees. It doesn't matter. It's not good to always look for the disadvantages of others. This is not good. You go home and look in the mirror to see what's wrong with you! "Said the dog." The monkey is so thin and the tree climbs so fast. It must be an expert at stealing things.
