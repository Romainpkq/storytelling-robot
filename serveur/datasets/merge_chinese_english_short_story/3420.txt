Cradle Blue Sky is a cradle, shaking baby star, white clouds floating gently, baby star asleep. The sea is a cradle, shaking the baby fish, the waves are gently turned, and the baby fish is asleep. The garden is a cradle, and the baby is shaking, the wind blows gently, and the baby is asleep. Mother's hand is the cradle, shaking the baby, the song is sung gently, the baby is asleep.
