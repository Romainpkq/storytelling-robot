There are many insects in nature sanitation that look uncomfortable, but in fact their work is very valuable. Although they are not treated fairly for this reason, they still work silently. When you find a dead rat on the roadside, walk in and you will see a lot of ants, beetles and flies gather on it. Goose bumps on you will definitely go up and run away with your nose covered. Do you think these insects are very dirty and terrible and disgusting? The fact is not what you think. These insects are so busy that they are doing cleaning work for this world. Remember, they are hardworking sanitation workers in nature.
