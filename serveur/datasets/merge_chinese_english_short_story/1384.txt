Fun zoo This afternoon, my mother took me to the zoo to see animals. The zoo is really lively and there are all kinds of animals. On the big tree, the naughty little monkey is swinging. Monkeys are very naughty, jumping up and down, making everyone laugh. On the grass, the cute giant panda is eating green bamboo leaves. In the pool, the sea lions are performing their headers, and applause from tourists is heard from time to time. On the blue lake, two white swans are shaking their red feet and playing happily. In the sky, the birds flapped their wings and flew freely. The zoo is really lively and there are all kinds of animals.
