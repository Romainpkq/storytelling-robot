Beautiful bubbles In the bright sunlight, we blow up colorful bubbles. Big and small bubbles fly to the blue sky. Some are like small dewdrops, and some are like beautiful colored balls. Bubbles flew to the classroom and came to visit our classroom; Bubbles flew to space and danced with the stars in the sky; Bubbles flew to the lawn, holding hands with the grass hand, shoulder by shoulder, so beautiful!
