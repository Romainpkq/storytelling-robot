Spiders in flower clothes Spiders are wearing gray clothes for generations. Old spiders always admonish little spiders: this kind of clothing is certainly not good-looking, but it is easy to hide and not easy to be invented by prey. If you want to eat a full stomach, don't worry about making yourself handsome. To be pretty, you have to have a party like Butterfly. Spiders all listen to the words of the esteemed master. They have been wearing clothes that are gray and unbroken from generation to generation. However, beauty is indeed too attractive. One day, several little spiders resolutely took off their gray clothes, put on colorful dresses, and all the flower branches that they wore fluttered, so unhappy. The old spider with a lesson hastened to warn the rest of the spiders: "Children, don't learn from them! They are so arrogant and sure to suffer! You just wait and see!" But the old spider's words have not been fulfilled. Not only are the spiders in flower clothes not hungry, they also catch more insects than other spiders. Because there are many beautiful bugs in the forest, their flowers and clothes are regarded as blooming flowers!
