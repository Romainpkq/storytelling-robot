Mother is a mountain, tall and steady. Mountain, beauty, tenderness. Mother is a mountain. My mother is a mountain, and I am a tree. The mountain nurtures the tree. My mother loves me very much, love deeply, love really. She was like a mountain, and she did not hesitate to use the trickle of her life to nourish me who is thirsty-a small tree that made me grow leafy. My mother is a mountain, I am a tree, and the mountain cares about the tree. Mother 's bright eyes are always watching me with concern. These eyes are full of love, full of warmth, give me comfort, give me hope, give me strength, let me change from cowardice to strong, from childish to mature.
