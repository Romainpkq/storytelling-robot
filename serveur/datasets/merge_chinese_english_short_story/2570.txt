I grew up on Sunday. Mom and Dad went to visit Uncle Tao's house. My dad said anxiously, "Let â€™s go visit, what do you do?" I quickly said, "You can rest assured, I will take care of myself." When it was time to cook, I learned to be a mother and left the pot On the stove, then pour a bit of cold water and cover the pot. After a while, steam "fluttered" from under the lid. When I opened the lid and looked at it, a burst of heat rushed on. The water in the pot was tumbling up and down, bubbling bubblingly. There was a tense in my heart, and I quickly poured the cold rice down, and "hot", hot water splashed to the ground, I hurried back, almost burning. The water splashed on the grate quickly dried up, and everything was calm again. I picked up the spoon and put it in the pot, stirred it a few times, and added a little MSG, salt, pickles, and a few more times. The fragrance smelt out, and the rice bowl was finally cooked. At this time, my mother came back and saw me the fragrant rice bowl and praised me continuously. But I proudly said, "I'm grown up and I can do more for you in the future." At this time, my mother came back and praised me with the fragrant rice bowl that I was burning.
