Fireworks "bang, bang, bang", with a burst of roar, a bunch of fireworks flew into the night sky, I quickly looked up, ah, how beautiful! "Red Link Star" bloomed in the night sky, reflecting a piece of fiery red in the night sky. With the sound of "cracks and pops", countless strings of small sparks on a parachute hung over the sky, fluttering lightly and slowly, just like the lanterns on the sky full of festival lights. "Boom," another loud noise, another string of fireworks rose up, and they were shuttled among the lanterns, forming a beautiful pattern.
