Animals on land make various sounds. "Wang Wang Wang" is a dog barking, "Mimi Mi" is a cat barking, "咩咩 咩" is a sheep barking, "Oh oh oh" is a rooster barking. The oriole's bark is as good as singing, but the parrot can learn to talk to people. Fish in the ocean bark just like animals on land. You hear, it's the sound of an octopus, as melodious as the sound of a piano. The lionfish makes a "haha" laugh, and the balloonfish also makes a "snoring" sound, as if the sleeping person was snoring. Animals on land make various sounds.
