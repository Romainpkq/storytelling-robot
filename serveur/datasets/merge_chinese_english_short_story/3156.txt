The little crab on the beach practises writing on the beach by the sea. He writes and writes, the words become crooked. Uncle Ocean Wave rushed over and hurriedly erased his character. The little crab writes again. Writing, writing, the words have become crooked again. Uncle Hailang came to help him erase the words again. The little crab was not discouraged. He suffocated and began to write again. This time he was a little slower, but he was very careful. This line of words was one after another, and he was written neatly and correctly. Mother Seagull flying by the sea said to her little seagulls: "Look, how beautiful the words of the little crab are!" "Mom, what is he writing?" Asked the little seagulls. "What he wrote is: A good boy is not afraid of difficulty." Mother Seagull said. This time, Uncle Ocean Wave never washed the word away, but left the word on the beach.
