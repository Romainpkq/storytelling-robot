Red flowers and green leaves are here in spring, and the flowers are in bloom. How beautiful the flower blooms, people take pictures of it. The flowers bloomed, how fragrant, the bees circled around it. The flowers laughed, but the flowers were happy! The flower laughed, and a flower became proud. It doesn't look at the green leaves around it. It feels that the leaves are ordinary. No one looks at it. It's too ordinary. While a gust of wind was blowing, this flower fell from the tree and left the green leaves as soon as it was hardened. The flowers fluttered in the wind, and after a while, the flowers dried up, like a piece of waste paper, and were swept into the trash. When I saw other flowers, I never dared to leave the green leaves again. Only then did they understand that the green leaves were silent, and they worked hard, making all kinds of nutrients in the sun to supply themselves. With green leaves, our flowers are red; with green leaves, our flowers are fragrant; with green leaves, our flowers can bear fruit. The flowers fluttered in the wind, and after a while, the flowers dried up, like a piece of waste paper, and were swept into the trash.
