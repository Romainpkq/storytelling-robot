We have a lot of useful little animals around us, such as dragonflies, little swallows, and frogs. Let 's go and see the dragonfly first! You see, a dragonfly is resting on a branch! The dragonfly has big eyes on its head, it really looks like a searchlight. It also has a pair of transparent wings. Its body is thin and long, so slim. Not only does it eat pests, it is also a weather forecaster. When it flies low, it means that the weather has changed. Go and see the little swallows again! You see, a little swallow is busy catching flying insects in the sky! The swallow wore a black tuxedo. The tail is like a small pair of scissors. It is also a weather forecaster. The weather will change when it is flying low. Hey, hey, who is here? Oh, it's a little frog. It had a pair of big eyes and was wearing turquoise clothes and exposed white and white belly. It was lovely. It can eat thousands of pests a year. It is a good helper to protect the crops. There are many, many useful little animals around us! We must take good care of those lovely little lives! You see, a dragonfly is resting on a branch!
