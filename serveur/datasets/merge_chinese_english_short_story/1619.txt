On the river, there was a small wooden bridge. After an elephant walked over it, the wooden bridge became an old ringing bridge. Every day, when the little animals walk on the bridge, they can hear nice songs. Below, the little river is singing, clapping; in the middle, the small wooden bridge is singing, creaking; above, the little bird is singing, babbling. It's so fun! One day, the elephant will cross the river again. The elephant stood by the bridge, listening to the song, "I can't walk this bridge. If I walk over the bridge, the bridge that can sing will never sing again." On the river, there is a small wooden bridge After an elephant walked from above, the wooden bridge became an old ringing bridge.
