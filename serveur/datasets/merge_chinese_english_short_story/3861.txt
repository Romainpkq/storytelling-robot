Brave little rooster Little rooster comes to the grass with mother chicken every day. When he meets other small animals to bully other chickens, he always rushes up bravely. One day, a fierce eagle flew over the grass, and the mother chicken asked the chicks to quickly hide in the grass. The little rooster tried to rush to drive away the eagle, and the mother chicken pulled him.

The mother chicken said to him: "A person's ability is limited, but being brave is not enough. Dealing with the eagle, hard It does n’t work, it ’s also a good way to avoid him. "
