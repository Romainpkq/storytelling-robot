Some mother earth mothers don't take care of the children of mother earth. They cut down trees, fold flowers, and destroy grassland. Mother Earth lost her child, naked, basked by the sun, and blown by the cold wind.

Mother Earth hopes that we can take care of her and let her return to her former glory. Some mother earth mothers don't take care of the children of mother earth.
