Meteorological tree In the south of China, there is a tree called red leafy red bean. On sunny days, its leaves are green. If there is going to be a rainy day, the leaves under this canopy will first turn red and then gradually go up to the top of the tree. If it is found on a rainy day that the leaves change from red to light red, and then gradually return to green, this indicates that the weather will become fine. Therefore, people call small leaf red bean trees "change trees" and "meteorological trees". Have you ever seen such a tree? How interesting! If it is found on a rainy day that the leaves change from red to light red, and then gradually return to green, this indicates that the weather will become fine.
