One day, a boy was sitting under an apple tree, and suddenly an apple fell from the tree and landed on the ground. The boy saw it and found it very strange. He thought, "Once the apples are ripe, why do they fall to the ground, but they don't fly to the sky, nor do they leave to the left or right?" When the boy discovered this problem, he focused his research. Later, he finally found out that the secret of the apple falling is because the earth is attractive.
