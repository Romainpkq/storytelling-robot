Rain in autumn This morning, the weather is fine, but it rained in the afternoon. The raindrops “cracked and cracked” and knocked on the glass windows, and a lot of “water splashes” immediately gathered on the window glass, and they jumped happily! Through the glass window, I looked out, and there seemed to be a huge curtain hanging between the world and the curtain. This curtain was not made of cloth, but woven with rain silk. Across the rain curtain, the building opposite was blurred, and a long curtain of drops of water hung under the eaves. In the rain, a leaf becomes like a watercolour that is not dry. The gray sky is the background, and the bright wet leaves are the main characters in the painting. Some leaves that fell to the ground by the rain seemed to have their heads up, looking at their partners in the tree, and they felt very sad. After the rain, the weather was obviously cold. A coat I wore seemed very thin, so I quickly added a dress.
