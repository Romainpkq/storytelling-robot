In the morning when the sun was in the fog, I just ran up and hurried to the balcony. Yeah! The fog is really big, and the thick fog in the sky makes the earth vague and a piece of dim. After a while, the eastern sun slowly rose. The sun that just came out was like a big fireball, not dazzling at all. The fog rises slowly under the sun, and the rise gradually dissipates. The sun rises and rises slowly, the sun shines on the ground, and the dew on the blades of grass shines like pearls. The sun emits thousands of rays of light, so that a few white clouds floating in mid-air become golden in a flash. After a while, it was dyed rose again. In the east, half of the sky is stained red. The scenery is very beautiful.
