Speaking of hygiene, right to right, the trunk, open mouth, standing on the side of the road, who is it calling? Hey Hey hey ! Who is that ? Don't throw the peel all over! The little sister, when she heard it, picked up the peel and threw it into the box. Children, when it comes to hygiene, change when you know what is wrong, right or right. Don't throw the peel all over!
