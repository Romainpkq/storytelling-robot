There are small drops of water on the back of the little turtle, and it must be hot and sweaty. Sweetly hurriedly fanned it. Dad told sweet that the turtle is like a fish, a cold-blooded animal, and it is not afraid of heat. Sweating is because the turtle's back is cold and there is more water vapor in the air. Small drops of water have formed on the turtle's back, indicating that it is going to rain. Sweating is because the turtle's back is cold and there is more water vapor in the air.
