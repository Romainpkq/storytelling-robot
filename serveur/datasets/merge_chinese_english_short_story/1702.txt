The old spider with lessons hastened to warn the remaining spiders: "Kids, don't learn from them! They are so flaunting, sure to lose! You just wait and see!" But the old spider's words did not come true. Not only are the spiders in flower clothes not hungry, they also catch more bugs than other spiders.
