During the summer vacation, my father took me to travel by plane. On the plane, through the window, I saw the blue sky and saw the white clouds. The plane flew higher and higher, flying higher than the white clouds. After getting off the plane, we took a coach and came to the foot of the mountain to find that the people who had come early had already started climbing. My father and I hurried up the mountain. We climbed halfway up the mountain and saw a group of monkeys. The monkey saw us, ran over, reached out his hand, and asked us to eat something. We looked down on the top of the mountain and saw that the people on the path under the mountain were very small and very small, and they all became a dwarf country. It was really interesting! I like to travel .
