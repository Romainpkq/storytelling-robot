The little pig, the lamb and the bunny discuss the bubble blowing game together. The piglet prepared the shampoo; the lamb prepared the detergent; the rabbit prepared the soapy water. They each took a straw and started to blow bubbles. The pig was blowing upwards, "Bang! Bang!" The bubble burst. The lamb blew down forcefully: "Bang! Bang!" The bubble burst. The little rabbits blow slowly, and the bubbles fly up to the sky one after another. The colorfulness is extremely beautiful.
