Blue dragonfly and fat frog A blue dragonfly stopped on a lotus leaf. He was thinking about something. A fat frog didn't see the blue dragonfly. He jumped hard on the lotus leaf. The blue dragonfly flew with fright. The fat frog was very embarrassed. He said, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean it!" The blue dragonfly was not angry. He said, "Little frog, I would love to make friends with you." "Why?" Asked the little frog strangely. "Because you know how to be polite." The blue dragonfly flew to the fat frog. "Thank you, I am also very willing to make friends with you!" The fat frog said with a smile, "You are not angry with me, forgive me, which makes me very happy." In this way, the blue dragonfly and the little frog became good friends .
