A child was sitting in the yard, leaning on grandma, looking up, counting the stars at the sky. One, two, and counted down to several hundred. Grandma smiled and said, "Stupid child, counting the stars again. So many stars, flickering and flickering, seeing the flowers, can you count them?" The child said, "Grandma, I can see See, you can count them clearly. The stars are moving, but not chaotic. You see, this star and that star are always so far apart. "Grandpa came over and said," Children, you see very well Be careful. The stars in the sky are moving, but it seems that the distance between them is constant.

The star facing the mouth is the North Star. The Big Dipper always orbits the North Star." What Grandpa said is that true? The child didn't sleep well all night and got up to see the stars several times. He could see clearly that the Big Dipper was turning slowly around Polaris.

"Grandpa came over and said," Boy, you look very carefully.
