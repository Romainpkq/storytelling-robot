The sky here on the prairie is exceptionally blue, and the air is particularly fresh. The white flock walks leisurely on the green grass, just like the big white flowers embroidered on the green carpet. The shepherd rode a galloping horse, waved a sheep whip, and sang the beautiful pastoral song: "White clouds float in the blue sky, and the horses run under the white clouds ..." Ah, a vibrant scene on the beautiful prairie!
