During the lesson, Xiao Hong went to the pool to wash her hands. She saw that the pool was very dirty and was about to clean it, and the bell for class rang. After school, she and some children bit their ears and came to the pool together. They rolled up their cuffs and started to work hard. Some of them wiped the moss in the pool, and some of the grass by the pool, and even the surrounding paper heads, withered grass, and leaves were cleaned. After cleaning, they stood in front of the pool and saw that the pool had been changed into clean "clothes". They were indescribably happy.
