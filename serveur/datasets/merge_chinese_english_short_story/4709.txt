Spring is here, the flowers are blooming, the grass is green, and the small tree is also sprouting. The little horse is here, stepping on the grass, and the little bear is coming, shaking the little tree. The little monkey came and removed the flowers. The flowers and trees cried and said, "We don't like such friends. Please go away." The little bird came, catching insects, the bees came, and spreading pollen. The children came and watered. Flowers, trees and trees said with a smile: "We all like such friends, you stay."
