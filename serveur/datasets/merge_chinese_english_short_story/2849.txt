On the balcony of my house is a pomegranate tree with green leaves. The pomegranate tree is in bloom, and their flowers are not fragrant, but they are hot and red, like a small trumpet, how beautiful! It bears two little pomegranates, and it has turned red, like two little lanterns, the wind blows, and it shakes. I water it every day and hope it grows up soon.
