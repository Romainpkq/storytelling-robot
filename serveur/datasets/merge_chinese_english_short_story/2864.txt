The little seeds ticked, ticked, and the drizzle kept falling, waking the seeds in the dirt. Tick ​​Tick, the raindrops are constantly spraying, nourishing the dry little seeds. Tick ​​Tick, the little seed sticks out his feet, sticks out his head, and grows into a bud with a hat. The rain stopped and the warm sun shone, and the young shoots took off the hat from their heads. The rain stopped and a gentle spring breeze blew, and the young buds put on their new green clothes. Tick ​​Tick, the little seed sticks out his feet, sticks out his head, and grows into a bud with a hat.
