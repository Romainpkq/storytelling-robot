The colorful "Children 's Day" today is the "Children' s Day" International Children 's Day and it is our own holiday. In the morning, our school organized a "June 1" celebration. Look, the colorful flags fluttered around the school. The students were all trembling. The bright red scarves were particularly dazzling, and the laughter went straight into the sky. The wonderful show began. See, the trumpet player and the tambourine have their own postures and their own blowing and playing styles. Wonderful shows one by one, the little singers let go of their bright voices, and the beautiful voices spread throughout the campus. The little girls danced in beautiful dresses. The audience watched it with interest and bursts of warm applause from time to time. Unconsciously, the show was over and the campus gradually returned to peace. We reluctantly left the campus.
