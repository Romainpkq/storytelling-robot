Where is the wind where is the wind The wind is in the sky. You see, it's running forward with clouds blowing like a sailboat on the sea. Where is the wind? The wind is over the willows. You see, it blows gently against the wicker, like children are dancing. Where is the wind? The wind is on the water. You see, the sparkling waves it blows, the duckweed on the water keeps shaking. Where is the wind? what ! The wind is in my hands. I waved the air, and the wind came. I waved the air, and the wind came.
