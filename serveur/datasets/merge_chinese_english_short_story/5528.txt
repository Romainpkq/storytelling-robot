Going to school in the face of the cold wind, "Xiaobo, Xiaobo!" Grandma's cry awakened me from a sweet sleep, and I quickly got up. "Yeah! It's so cold!" I retracted into the bed, only to hear the north wind blowing outside. I really wanted to sleep a little longer, but I thought of the teacher saying "I have to go to school on time every day" and immediately got dressed and got out of bed. After breakfast, my whole body was very warm. The wind seems to be deliberately making fun of me, and the wind is even more fierce. I thought to myself: "Wind! Wind! You can only scare the cowards. To learn skills, no matter how cold, I have to go to school on time!" Carrying his schoolbag, he walked toward the school with the north wind blowing.
