Plants also need to sleep Everyone knows that people and animals must sleep, but many plants also need to sleep. Red clover in the sunshine, three petit leaves spread out on each petiole, appearing energetic; at night, the three petit leaves were closed together, as if closing their eyes. In the bright sunny day, the leaves stretched out, looking happy and joyful. Night fell, and the leaves were paired together, and they slept beautifully. Water lilies, when they arrived in the early morning of a day, slowly opened their petals to reveal a charming smile. In the setting sun, the water lilies gradually closed their petals and entered their dreamland. Plants sleep, some can prevent frost, and some can reduce the loss of heat and moisture. From this point of view, plants, like humans, need to sleep. In the bright sunny day, the leaves stretched out, looking happy and joyful. Night fell, and the leaves were paired together, and they slept beautifully.
