The kitten, the puppy, and the pig are drawing together. The little cat drew a sun, a house, and a big tree with a bird on it. It said to the piglet, "Look, I can draw anything!" Piglet said, "You're so smart." But the puppy said, "Can you paint the wind? The wind can't be seen or touched. No one can draw it." The kitten took the pen and tapped her lips gently, blinked, and thought for a while, and said, "I can!" It was right next to the sun, and a white cloud was drawn on the house, saying, "White clouds float in the sky, Didn't it let the wind blow? The wind, it was drawn! "It was right next to the sun, and a white cloud was painted on the house, saying," Isn't the white cloud floating in the sky?
