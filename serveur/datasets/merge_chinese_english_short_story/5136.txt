Two years ago, my family â€™s long tail brought back a little bird from the construction site, with a pair of bright, small eyes, towards me, squeaked, squeaked, as if to say, "Sister, sister." This little Bird, my father called it a pulsatilla; its tail is very long, I gave it a name: "Long tail". I really like the "long tail" and feed it every day to eat millet and green vegetables. "Long tail." I like cleaning very much. I bathe in a small water tank every day. Look, how interesting it looks like taking a bath! The small head stretched into the water tank, and then slammed backwards, and then combed the feathers with its beak, and its wings were still shaking. "The long tail" is the closest to me. Whenever I approach the bird cage, it will make a pleasant scream and open its wings to welcome me. "Long tail" has been in my house for two years, and white hair has been changed on the top of my head. It grew up with me.
