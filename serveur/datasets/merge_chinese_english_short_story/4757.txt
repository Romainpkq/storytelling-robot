Spring girl Spring girl is here. Where did she come from? She came from the south. The good news was that the swallow told me. What does she look like? She is a little girl who looks prettier than me, her eyes are watery, and a braid is so long! She had two bare feet and her trousers were on her knees; on her arm was a big willow basket. Everyone will be happy when she sees her; anyone will be happy when she hears her singing. In her big willow basket, filled with red flowers, green grass, and golden seeds.
