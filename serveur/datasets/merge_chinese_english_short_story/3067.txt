The Banana Forest Primary School held an intellectual contest, and many animals came to participate. The elephant teacher came up with a question: How did the three people eat two bananas in a short time? The Gray Wolf, Fox and Goat teams finished the answer first. They are divided like this. The Gray Wolves cut two bananas from the middle, and each person ate half of the bananas. The remaining half were thrown away. No one wants to find it back. The gray wolf thinks this is the fairest. The Foxes simply peeled both bananas. You bite and I bite and eat. After the bananas are eaten, it is fair to say that everyone is within one bite. What about the goats? Also cut the banana in the middle and give it to the elephant teacher first half, and the rest will eat half each. Smart children, which team do you think won the first place?
