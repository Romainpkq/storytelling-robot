The small tree came through the winter, and the northwest wind was blowing, and we put on a cotton coat. Dad said: "We are cold, and the little tree is cold too. We should help the little tree to survive the winter safely." As Dad brought straw and rope, I quickly followed Dad to the little tree. We first wrapped the trunk of the small tree with straw, and then tied it carefully one by one with a rope. Looking at the small tree in front of me, I said happily, "When wearing a winter coat, the small tree will not be afraid of wind and rain or snow." We first wrapped the trunk of the small tree with straw, and then tied it carefully with a rope one by one.
