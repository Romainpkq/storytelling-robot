One day, roosters and ducks are better than anyone. They are better than running. The cock flew in a row and dropped the duck a long way. When the duck swayed, it couldn't catch up. The cock proudly said to the ducks, "You can believe that I am great!" They are better than swimming. The duck swims fast and steadily. The cock is covered with water and almost drowns. The duck also proudly said to the rooster, "In the end, my ability is great." No one is convinced by them. The cock flew in a row and dropped the duck a long way. When the duck swayed, it couldn't catch up.
