On the night of the Lantern Festival, the streets are crowded with lights and lights. There are so many lanterns on the street! Rabbits ran on the ground, pigeons ran on the sky, and the most interesting was the dragon lantern. I saw a long dragon chasing up and down the orb, the scales of the whole body shone with gold, and the dragon's tail kept swinging. The children couldn't help shouting, "Long is here!" The singing, laughter, and gongs and drums sounded into a piece of the night sky. Happy people ushered in a spring.
