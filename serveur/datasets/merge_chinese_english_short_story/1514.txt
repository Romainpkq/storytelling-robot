Children love their hometown and paint their own beautiful hometown. Taotao's hometown is by the sea. The sea he painted is so blue and so wide. One ship was filled with fish and shrimp. The child who picked the shell on the beach with his bare feet was Taotao. The hometown of Shanshan is in the mountains. The mountains he painted were so high and the water so clear. The front and back of the house are tall and big trees. The mountains in the picture, with a small bamboo basket, are going to the forest to pick mushrooms. The hometown of Shanshan is in the mountains.
