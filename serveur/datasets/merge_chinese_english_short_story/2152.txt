A group of ants are moving to the hillside near the big tree. Some ants circled together, biting the biscuits with their mouths, and slowly moved forward; some ants were strong enough to bite the leaves alone; others were biting rice grains in pairs, climbing fast and fast stable. As soon as they moved home, the raindrops fell down. The ants are lying in their new home, admiring the rain outside and tasting the delicious food. This is really a happy treat.
