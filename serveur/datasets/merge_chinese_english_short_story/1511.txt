The pony has grown up. The old horse invited the black dog to teach the pony to run, the goat to teach the pony to climb the mountain, and the ox to teach the little horse-drawn carriage. The ponies have learned and show the old horses the same. The old horse looked very happy, kissed the face of the pony and said, "You have learned so many skills, it is really a good boy." The pony said, "From tomorrow, I can help my mother do things, and I can go out. Doing things for everyone. "Said the horse." From tomorrow, I can help my mother do things, and I can go out and do things for everyone.
