The little gecko borrowed his tail. The little gecko climbed, and climbed to the small river. He saw the fish swimming with its tail wagging in the river. The little gecko said, "Sister, little fish, can you lend me your tail?" The little fish said, "No, I want to use the tail to divert water." The little gecko said goodbye to the little fish and climbed forward. The little gecko climbed, climbed, and climbed onto the big tree. He saw the old ox wagging his tail to eat grass under the tree. The little gecko said, "Uncle Yellow Cattle, can you lend me your tail?" The old ox said, "No, I want to use the tail to catch the flies." The little gecko said goodbye to the old ox and climbed forward. The little gecko climbed, and climbed under the eaves. He saw swallows flying with their tails flying in the air. The little gecko said, "Aunt Swallow, can you lend me your tail?" The swallow said, "No, when I'm flying, I have to use the tail to grasp the direction." The little gecko was sad that he couldn't borrow the tail. He crawled, crawled, crawled back home to find his mother. The little gecko told his mother about borrowing his tail. The mother said with a smile: "Stupid boy, turn around and look at it." The little gecko turned and looked at it with joy, "I have a new tail!" He saw the little fish swimming by the tail in the river Swim.
