In the place where I lived when I was a kid, the leaves will speak softly, the grass will gently shake hands, and the flowers will blush and smile. Where I lived as a child, the birds will sing happily, the streams will flow freely, and a fragrance will float in the sky. Where I lived when I was a kid, a thin line will pop up and fly quietly into my atrium, making me feel infinitely warm and full of sunshine.
