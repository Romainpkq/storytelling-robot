The rustling footsteps of the spring girl were close. The infinitely bright spring colors on the fields dress up the river even more enchanting. The grass on the shore somehow sneaked out of the soil secretly and danced lightly in the spring breeze. The grass looked like a green carpet in the sun. The children were sitting on it, lying down, and some were rolling. The little lamb jumped beside his mother "bleep". On both banks of the river, rows of weeping willows, with tender green shoots, cuckoos, magpies, jumping on the branches, singing a clear and graceful song, weeping willow branches stretched into the defrosting stream, as if to wash away the cold in winter. The breeze blew, and the water surface was rippled, and the green trees and green trees reflected in the water expanded and contracted, and gathered together, and scattered, like naughty fish swimming there.
