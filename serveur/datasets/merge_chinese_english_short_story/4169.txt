The apple of the first big apple, the bear family, was ripe, and he invited a little friend to taste it together. The little bear picked a big red apple from the tree. Who will eat it first? The little deer said: "I watered the apple tree and fertilized it. Let me eat this big apple." The little monkey said: "In winter, I will put a thick straw coat on the fruit tree. Give me this big apple. "The kitten said," When the fruit is buggy, I sprayed the potion and killed all the bugs. Let me eat this big apple. "What should I do? The bear's eyes rolled, cut the apple into six pieces, picked the two largest pieces and handed them to his father and mother. Oh ! The little friends understood: Eat first, think of the elders first, and it is the happiest of all to share happiness.
