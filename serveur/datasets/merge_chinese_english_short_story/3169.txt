Doudou's bad habits Doudou always likes to lick things. He said he wanted to taste the taste of things. His mother told him that it was unhygienic, he didn't listen, and he often grabbed toys and licked. He often said: "People have said it, it's not clean, it's okay to eat it." Mom didn't do anything to him. The bacteria on the plastic elephant were licked into the stomach by Doudou. My stomach hurts! Doudou rolled in pain. Mother saw it and hurried him to the hospital. The doctor said, "Little Doudou, you will get sick by licking things. Now you have to take an injection to take medicine!" Little Doudou nodded silently. Since then, Doudou will no longer lick toys. Not only did he not lick things randomly, he also developed the good habit of washing hands and changing clothes frequently. Now that everyone has seen Doudou, they all praise him as a good boy who loves cleanliness.
