Calendar The old man stepped on firecrackers and flew with snowflakes. Look, who is coming towards us? Ah, it was the old man who came to the calendar. Calendar The old man is so good, so give us a gift. Not a big holiday cake, not a sweet refined toffee. It is a thick brand new calendar with a total of 365 sheets. Give us 365 suns and 365 moons. Go to school in the summer and teach us not to be afraid of the heat, and read early in the winter to teach us not to be afraid of the frost. We accompany us throughout the year, study hard, and improve day by day. Ah, how precious the old man's gift is, we must treasure it in our hearts. Let each one become a sail and lead us to sail daily in the sea of ​​knowledge. Ah, how precious the old man's gift is, we must treasure it in our hearts.
