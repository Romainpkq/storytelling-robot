Our little village is beautiful. There are mountains in the distance and orchards in the vicinity. There is a crooked river on the left, and a straight road on the right. There is a breeding factory in front of the village, which breeds many white rabbits and black rabbits. There is a forest behind the village with many poplars and willows of different heights.
