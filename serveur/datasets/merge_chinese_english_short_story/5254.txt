One summer evening, Wang Mian grazed cattle by the lake. Suddenly, the clouds were overcast and there was a heavy rain. After the heavy rain, the sun shone brightly on the lake. The lotus blossoms in the lake are more vivid. The pink petals are clear of water droplets, and the green lotus leaves are rolling with water droplets.
