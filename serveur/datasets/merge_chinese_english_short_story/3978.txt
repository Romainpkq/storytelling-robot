Watching the Lantern Festival One day in September, night fell and had a good dinner. I followed my father excitedly to the Lantern Festival in the stadium. When I entered the door, I looked at it with a glance. The whole stadium was like a sea of ​​lights, colorful, and the surroundings were like daylight. The golden light was splendid, so impressive! I followed in my father's footsteps and visited various exquisite palace lanterns, horse lanterns, crystal elephant lanterns and so on. The more I look at it, the more excited I am, and the more curious I look. The thing I like particularly is the "Peacock Lamp". The feathers on the screen of the peacock are like jewels filled with bright colors. The mouth of the "Dragon Lantern" merged one by one, spitting out a string of pearls as if it were alive. I think: If the lamp is compared to the stars in the sky, the stars are not as colorful as it is; if the lamp is compared to the flowers on the ground, the flowers are not as dazzling as it is. At the end of the visit, my father asked me: "What are these lights made of?" I took a closer look, yeah, these lights are made of small bottles, pots, bamboo, etc. The designer of the lamp, how clever and clever they are, what a wonderful bright world they make up with these gadgets!
