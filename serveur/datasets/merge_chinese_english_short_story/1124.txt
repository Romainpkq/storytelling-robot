Trees that don't deciduous The cold wind blows, and the yellow leaves drive down the cold wind gently. But pine trees and holly are very beautiful in green clothes all year round. Why is this? It turns out that the leaves of pine trees are coniferous, like needles. Water does not slip away from the leaves. They are not afraid of water shortage, so they don't need fallen leaves. Holly 's leaves are broad, and the leaves are covered with a layer of wax-like things, and the water will not slip away, so they are not deciduous in winter. In fact, they are sometimes falling leaves, and only careless children say they can't drop leaves. After they have dropped their leaves, new leaves will continue to grow. Holly 's leaves are broad, and the leaves are covered with a layer of wax-like things, and the water will not slip away, so they are not deciduous in winter.
