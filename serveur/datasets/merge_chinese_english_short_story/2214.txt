Impatiens In June, the impatiens gradually bloomed, some like butterflies, and some like pompoms. There are pink, crimson, purple, and white. The girls picked the petal juice and dyed their red nails, but they did not fade for a long time. According to grandma, Bai Fengxian can be treated with Chinese medicine! Grandpa said, planting impatiens in front of the house can drive away the poisonous snake. The flowering period of Impatiens is very long, some wither, some open, and some results, almost at the same time. The fruit is shaped like a jujube nucleus and changes color from green to yellow, indicating that it is ripe. If people touch it with their hands, it will explode immediately, the shell will roll up, and the black seed in the middle will be far away. Mom said that this is a special function of the Impatiens seed. Fengxian mother hopes that there will be more children and grandchildren next year.
