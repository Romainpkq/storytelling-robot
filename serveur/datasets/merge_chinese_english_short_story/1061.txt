Crows and Larks Crows really don't understand why Larks can sing such beautiful songs. When people talk about lark, they will praise it. The crow thought: If I could have a natural voice like a lark, how good would it be! The crow couldn't think of any good way, so he had to ask the lark for help, and he asked the lark to help it achieve its purpose. The lark told the crow: "If you want a good voice and sing beautiful songs, you have to get up early every morning, regardless of spring, summer, autumn and winter, and you will continue to practice in this way for a long time and you will be successful." Before the crow listened to the lark, he flew away (not convinced, dissatisfied). Those who are afraid of difficulties will get nothing.
