Duck fishing one evening, I came to the lake and saw a large group of wild ducks in the lake. Unfortunately, I didn't have bullets. Suddenly, I remembered that there was a small lard lump left in my hunting bag. I immediately pulled out the lard and quickly tied it to a long, thin rope, and then threw the rope into the water. The wild duck saw the lard and swam over immediately. A greedy wild duck swallowed lard. Because lard is slippery, it passes through the duck's intestine very quickly after it enters the duck's mouth and slips out of the duck's ass! In this way, the wild duck was put on my rope. At this time, the wild ducks came over and swallowed this lard one by one, and they were put on my rope one by one, and within 10 minutes, all the ducks were like beads Put it on. I dragged the wild ducks home, and after only a few steps, I was very tired. Suddenly, the wild ducks flew up and took me to the sky. Without any hassle, I made a rudder with my coat and directed the ducks to fly to my house.
