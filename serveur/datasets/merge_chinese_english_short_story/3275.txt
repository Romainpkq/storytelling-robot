Ai Hua study is very serious. When he is in class, he always pays attention to the teacher's lectures, thinks positively, and raises his hand to speak. His homework was completed on time every time, and the book was neat and beautiful. Once the school was over, the teacher sent the homework. When he saw an error in his homework, he stayed in the class to correct the homework. The other classmates all went home, but he was thinking hard in the classroom alone. Until he gave the correct answer, he showed a satisfied smile and went home with peace of mind.
