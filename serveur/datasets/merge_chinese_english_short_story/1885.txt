A crystal dewdrop stood on the blade of grass and said to me, "Do you look like I'm blowing bubbles like you? Let's be friends!" A round balloon also floated from a distance and said, "You See if I am the bubble you lost? Let me be friends with you! "... I ran home cheerfully and told my mother that I had many, many friends. I happily ran home and told my mother that I had many, many friends.
