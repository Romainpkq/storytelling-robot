How does a tree eat? A tree eats something very special. It does not rely on the mouth, but on the roots. Under the roots of the trees are many fine and small hairy roots. Big trees use these tiny roots to absorb nutrients and water from the soil. These nutrients and water are transported through the trunk to various parts of the laurel. In addition, the leaves, although small, also played a huge role. The leaves absorb the carbon dioxide in the air, and through photosynthesis, the carbon dioxide and the water absorbed by the roots from the soil are converted into carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are the main components of cellulose and lignin in the tree. Carbohydrates can also be converted into fats, proteins, and other organic matter to promote tree growth. Trees treat carbohydrates as food. Carbohydrates can also be converted into fats, proteins, and other organic matter to promote tree growth.
