The motherland is a big garden with small crayons. It is really beautiful, red, yellow, black, white, green, blue. The red pen draws the sun, a circle. Blue strokes on the river, three curved lines. Yellow pen draws a small piece, that is a small sailboat. The green pen draws a big triangle, that is a mountain. Draw all kinds of crayons together to draw a large garden of the motherland.
