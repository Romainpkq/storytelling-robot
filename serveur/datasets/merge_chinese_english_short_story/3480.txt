Washing my father's hair last night, my father was going to wash his hair. I had a sudden whims, shouting to wash him. I first sprinkled hot water on my dad's hair, then squeezed shampoo and rubbed it gently on my dad's head. Although I was very careful, my dad's face was covered with water and bubbles. I usually feel so easy to wash my hair, but I didn't expect it to be really easy to do. Dad seems to see through my mind and encourages me to say: "It doesn't matter. This is the first time you wash someone's hair. It doesn't matter if you don't wash well." After listening to his words, I was not as nervous as before. The flushing has also become smooth. After washing, I asked my father if he felt okay. He said happily: "It's great, my daughter is really grown up!" Unexpectedly, I only did a small thing to make my father so happy.
