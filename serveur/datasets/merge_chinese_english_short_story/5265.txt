The Kettle I Will Call Today, my mother bought a new kettle. From the appearance, it is the same as the ordinary kettle, but it has an obvious feature-it will be called. When the water boils, it will emit a whistle, as if shouting: "The water is boiling! The water is boiling!" "Why is it called?" After careful observation, I found a whistle on its lid. When the water boiled, because the lid was tight, the water vapor in the pot could only come out of the whistle, and the whistle rang. I think: This kettle is simple and practical to make, the person who invented it is really clever!
