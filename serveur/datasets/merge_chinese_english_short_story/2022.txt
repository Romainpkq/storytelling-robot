The little hen planted rice one day, and the little hen found some rice. She asked the duckling: "Would you like to grow rice with me?" Said the duckling. "It's too hard to grow rice. I'm afraid to bend over!" The hen had to grow rice herself. When the seedlings were tall, the little hen asked the kitten, "Would you like to weed with me?" The kitten said, "The weed is too hard. I'm afraid of foaming in the hands!" The little hen had to weed itself. When the rice is ripe, the little hen asks the piglet: "Would you like to collect rice with me?" The piglet said, "It's too hard to collect rice. I'm afraid I'll get covered with dirt!" The little hen had to collect the rice herself. The little hen made the rice into rice to make sweet and sweet white rice. To the duckling, the duckling lowered his head. For the little cat, the little cat blushed. To the piglet, the piglet said, "We will grow rice with you next year!" She asked the duckling, "Would you like to grow rice with me?"
