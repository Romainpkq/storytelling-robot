The colorful blood I do nâ€™t know who threw the broken glass on the road, causing dozens of earthworms to be stabbed while crossing the road, and he was in a coma because of too much bleeding and the situation was very serious. The animals sent the earthworm to the hospital for rescue. Rescue requires a lot of blood, but the blood bank inventory is not enough, so we have to call on the animals to donate blood. A long squid quickly swam to the beach to donate blood, but the green blood was flowing out of the thief, and it was not used. "Look at me." The transparent prawn got out of the water and bravely extended his arm. As a result, its blood was pale cyan, and it could not be used. Both the sea crab and the hair crab came to donate blood, and the results were pale green blood. A field snail came too, and its blood was like milk, and it was useless. Tian Luo's cousin is a snail, and his blood is light blue. The blood of small animals is really colorful! The animals sent the earthworm to the hospital for rescue.
