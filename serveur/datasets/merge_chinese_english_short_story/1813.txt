Good neighbor. Every morning, I can hear the call of the flower magpie. When I woke up, I lay on the windowsill and counted how many flower magpies had fallen from the big tree: one, two, three ... Ah, there are nine in total, which is two more than yesterday! I'm so glad that the flower magpie has taken the big trees of my house as their home! The flower magpie helps the tree to get rid of pests and wakes me up from sleep every day. The flower magpie is my good neighbor.
