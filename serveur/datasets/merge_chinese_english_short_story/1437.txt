They laughed at the black swan. The Black Swan was puzzled for a moment. At this time, the eldest sister came over and said earnestly: "Sister, we usually say that you are ugly, and that white swan beauty does not refer to your appearance, but to your inner heart. Usually, white swan thinks much for everyone, which is its advantage. ... you think of yourself all day long. Take the thing you did today, wouldn't it prove your ugliness? In fact, what use is smearing and disguising yourself, it is not the original shape after a heavy rain. If you really If you want to lose your ugliness, if you want to say that you are beautiful, you must thoroughly correct the shortcomings. " , White swan is ugly, I'm beautiful!
