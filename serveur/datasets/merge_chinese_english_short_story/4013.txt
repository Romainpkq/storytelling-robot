The scenery in the park is really beautiful. Today, the sun is shining brightly, and there are several white clouds floating in the blue sky. I and my mother and father rowed a boat in the lake of the park. The scenery in the park is so beautiful! There is a small bridge in the distance. At the end of the small bridge is a pavilion. The pavilion is filled with adults and children, and the surroundings are full of colorful flowers. The lawn by the lake is also very lively. Birds sing tactful songs on the trees. A group of children are playing the game of eagles and chicks under the big tree. There is also a beautiful big rooster striding forward bravely . On the lake is a group of beautiful white swans. They are playing and playing happily ... The scenery in the park is so beautiful! Sitting in the bow of the boat, I couldn't help singing loudly. My father and mother sang softly with me while rowing: "Today's weather is fine and sunny, with good scenery everywhere, good scenery ..."
