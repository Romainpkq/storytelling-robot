Summer nights are so beautiful. Summer nights are quiet in the park. In the pool, the water lily had just closed her eyes and was awakened by the wailing cry. She opened her eyes and saw that an ant was lying on a grass. The water lily asked, "Little Ant, what's the matter with you?" The little ant said, "I accidentally fell into the pond and couldn't reach the shore!" "Come on!" The water lily bent over and let him climb up. The little ant was very grateful and said repeatedly, "Thank you, Aunt Lily." The water lily said, "I will stay here tonight! You see, how beautiful the summer night is!" The little ant shook his head and said, "I have to Go home. Otherwise, Mom and Dad will be anxious. "Their words let the dragonfly resting on the water lily leaf hear. He asked: "Water Lily Girl, what's the matter?" "The little ants want to go home, but I can't send him." Dragonfly said: "Let me send the little ants!" The water lily asked: "It's so dark, you Can it be done? "At this time, a firefly came and said," I will illuminate you. "The little ant climbed on the" plane "and the dragonfly took off. Fireflies lit a small lantern in front. The dragonfly flies, flies over the green rockery, flies over the green lawn, flies to a flower bed, and the little ants arrive home. The stars saw it and blinked happily. Oh, what a beautiful summer night!
