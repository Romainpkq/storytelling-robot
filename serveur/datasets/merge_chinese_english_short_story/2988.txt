In the spring of Guozigou, the Guozigou in Xinjiang is full of flowers. In addition to the colorful wildflowers on the hillside, there are also apricot flowers, apple flowers, hawthorn flowers, and pear flowers full of trees. Bunches, clumps, patches, red and glamorous, blue and shining, white and gleaming, until the top of the mountain meets the rainbow in the sky. Gradually, there are fewer flowers and more fruits. Red, green, yellow, one by one, one after another, clusters, clusters, like stars, covered mountains and hills, not at a glance. Guozigou is really a good place with many flowers and many fruits.
