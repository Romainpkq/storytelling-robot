The little squirrel got sick. The little squirrel got sick and was hospitalized. All the little animals came to visit her. Little monkeys bring peaches, little bees bring honey, little white rabbits send cabbage, and calves send milk. The Lark Bird sang a song: "I wish you well soon!" The Oriole also opened his throat: "Wish you come back among us." The little squirrel looked at his roommate and shed tears with excitement.
