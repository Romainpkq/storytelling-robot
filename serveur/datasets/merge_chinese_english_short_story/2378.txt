Planting the sun I have a beautiful wish to grow the sun when I grow up. It is enough to plant one seed, and many suns will be produced. One for the Antarctic and one for the Arctic Ocean. One in winter and one in the evening. At that time, every corner of the world will be warm and bright. Planting the sun I have a beautiful wish to grow the sun when I grow up.
