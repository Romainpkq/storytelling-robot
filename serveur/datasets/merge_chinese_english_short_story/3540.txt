The woodpecker and the tree were on the green grass, and a big tree cried out loudly: "Don't move me! Don't move me! I'm hurt!" "Mr. Tree, you are sick, I'm catching insects for you! Said the Woodpecker sincerely. "It's an insult! I'm so young and strong, where are the bugs? I know, this is just an excuse to hit me and hurt me. Warn you, don't play tricks in front of me, get away!" The tree roared angrily . The woodpecker flew away embarrassedly. Since then, no woodpecker is willing to help this tree pecker. A few years later, there were more insects in the tree, and this "young and strong" tree finally turned into empty waste in the belly.
