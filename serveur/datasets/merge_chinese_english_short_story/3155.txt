There are many ways to spread plants. In addition to being spread by human picking, some trees spread seeds by wind, and can spread to far and far places. Some spread by water. Like coconuts, when they mature, the coconut fruit falls in the sea and drifts away with the water. Some rely on birds or other animals to eat the seeds into their stomachs. Because they cannot be digested, they are excreted with feces and spread to all directions, such as pomegranates, cherries, wild grapes, wild ginseng, etc. The pine nuts were taken away by the squirrel when storing winter grain.
