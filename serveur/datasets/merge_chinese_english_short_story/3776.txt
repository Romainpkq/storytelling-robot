In the past, there was a little ant who wanted to cross the river, but there was no bridge or boat. What should I do? It thought left and right, and finally came up with a good way. One day, the little ants came to the river and crawled under a big tree not far from the river. When they saw that the leaves on the tree were very big, they thought: How can they get the leaves down? At this moment, a squirrel shouted on the tree: "Little ant, what are you doing standing under the tree?" The little ant looked up hurriedly. It turned out to be a squirrel. It was so happy that he cried out, "Brother Squirrel, can you pick a leaf for me?" The squirrel was very happy to help others, so he picked a big thick leaf and threw it down. The little ant said happily, "Thank you, brother squirrel." The little ant dragged the big and thick leaf, and spent the effort of the nine cows and two tigers to drag the leaves to the river. The little ant carefully placed it on the river and sat on a small boat made of leaves as if he were swinging slowly on a swing. That day happened to be downwind. After a while, the boat swayed to the other side of the river. In this way, the little ant crossed the river peacefully. The little ants are willing to use their brains and have been praised by their friends.
