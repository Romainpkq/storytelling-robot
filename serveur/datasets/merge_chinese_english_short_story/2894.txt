The puppy was anxious to shout to the tiger: "Little white rabbit is almost at the end." At this moment, the tiger quickly got up and chased forward, but it was too late, and the white rabbit passed the end. The tiger lost the game and the puppy said to it, "You are so proud of yourself!" The tiger lowered its head in shame.
