I have a beautiful wish to plant the sun, so I can plant the sun when I grow up. It is enough to sow one seed, and it will produce many and many suns. One for the Antarctic and one for the Arctic Ocean. One hangs in winter and one hangs in the evening. By that time, every corner of the world will be warm and bright.
