Kingfisher (excerpt) Kingfisher likes to stop on the reeds by the water, and a pair of small red paws hold the reeds tightly. Its color is very bright, and the feathers on its head are like an olive-colored turban, embroidered with emerald green patterns. The feathers on the back are like a light green coat, and the feathers on the abdomen are like an auburn shirt. It is small and exquisite. Underneath a pair of translucent and flexible eyes, there are a pair of pointed and long mouths. The kingfisher's song is crisp, and love flies against the water. In a blink of an eye, he stopped lightly on the reed stalk. It watched motionlessly at the water surface with microwaves, waiting for the small fishes to swim up to the water surface.
