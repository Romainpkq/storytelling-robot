The sun doll who loves to play The sun doll in the sky likes to play with white clouds. Look, she bulged her mouth round, blowing towards the cloud around her, blowing, blowing out a pair of long ears, a short tail, a fat belly, and a round head melon. Ha, she changed that white cloud into a little white rabbit! The Sun Doll ran in the sky while blowing, blowing this white cloud into a lotus flower, blowing that white cloud into Snow White ... she became more and more happy, one I accidentally blew a white cloud into the sea and rolled into the sea together. Ah, she blew the white cloud into a beautiful white wave in the sea.
