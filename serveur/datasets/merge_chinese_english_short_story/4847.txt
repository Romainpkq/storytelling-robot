Voice Kingdom I like dreaming. In the dream, the sound fairy took me into the magical kingdom of sound. When I walked into the first door of the Kingdom of Sound, I heard the sounds of Xiaohe ’s “wowing” water, Grandpa Feng ’s “gasping” gasping, the rain of “Tick and Tick” rain, and the thunder of Gong Gong "Boom" snore. I seem to be in nature. When I stepped into the second door of the Kingdom of Sound, I heard the cry of a bird "chirp", the cry of a little dog "wang", the cry of a kitten "Meow", and the roar of a lion. I seem to have come to the zoo. A sound of car horns led me to the third door. I seemed to be walking on the road. I heard the sound of bicycles, the sound of trucks, and the sound of police cars, and the sound of the police car, "Didudidudu". It was dawn, the dream woke up, the small alarm clock sang a song, urging me to go to school quickly.
