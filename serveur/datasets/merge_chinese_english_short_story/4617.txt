Chun Chun awakened Chun Chun with a loud thunder. They broke through the soil, overturned the stones, and emerged one by one from the ground. The spring bamboo shoots are wrapped in a light brown coat, like a tender baby. They greet the spring breeze, laugh in the sun, and grow in the spring rain. Section by section, section by section, section by section. Go up, go up, go up again.
