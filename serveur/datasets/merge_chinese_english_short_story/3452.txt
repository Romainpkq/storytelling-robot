The person who loves the earth the most is its mother. Who is the mother of the earth? It is the sun. On one occasion, the earth suddenly missed Mother Sun, and it thought: "Mother Sun is so good to me. From birth until now, it has loved me so much. I should give Mother Sun a gift!" What? The earth thought for a long time, and could not think of the result. In the end, it decided to consult Uncle Feng, because Uncle Feng had traveled all over the world and had the broadest knowledge, and it would certainly help it solve this problem.
