Three monks legend In ancient times, a lively and smart little monk came to a temple on the mountain. At first, he picked water diligently. Not only did he drink enough, he also poured water into the net bottle in the hands of the bodhisattva, and the willow branches in the net bottle lived. Soon, a thin monk came. He had a dispute with the young monk about drinking water and carrying water. No one was willing to suffer a loss, so the two discussed to carry the water together. Later, a fat monk came again. All three monks had to drink water, but none of them was willing to carry more water. Within two days the water tank was exposed. The willow branches in the net bottle also withered from the lack of water. One night, while all three monks were dozing, a burning candle fell on the incense case, and the small temple caught fire. During the crisis, the three monks scrambled to pick up water to fight the fire, and a fire was quickly extinguished. After the fire, the three monks seemed to understand something. From then on, the water in the water tank was full again, and the three monks happily held the large bowl of drinking water, and the willow branch in the net bottle was restored to life.
