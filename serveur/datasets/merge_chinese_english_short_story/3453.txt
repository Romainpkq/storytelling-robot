Spring is here and the water of the small river is flowing. The trees on the shore were green, the peach blossoms were blooming, and the young wheat in the distance began to turn green. In this spring season, the teacher led the students to plant trees in the wild. Under the leadership of the teacher, some of them dug pits, some lifted water, and some planted seedlings. Everyone was doing a great job.
