There are hundreds of species of seabirds living on the sand islands in the South my country Sea. The largest number is the white bird. This white bird likes to eat fish the most. They look for fish on the sea in groups. They fly back to the island in the evening. The largest seabird is called the albatross. One of its wings is as long as two desks. It often spreads its wings and flies over the sea. It can fly for hundreds of miles before stopping.
