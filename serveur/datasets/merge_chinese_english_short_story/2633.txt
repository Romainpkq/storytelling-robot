Fenger came to look for the chubby pig. The chubby pig Bobo was sick. He was lying on the bed all day, shouting for a headache for a while, shouting for a sore throat, and no one played with him. "咚! 咚! 咚!" Who knocked on the window? Mom opened the window. It turned out to be wind. Fenger said, "I'm here to play with you. I brought you a floral fragrance!" The chubby pig smelled it. It's so fragrant. It's a little better. The next morning, "咚! 咚! 咚!" Who knocked on the window? Mom opened the window. It turned out to be wind. Feng'er said, "I'm here to play with you. I'll make your windmill turn!" The windmill turned "Da La Da La", and turned up. The chubby Popo danced with the windmill, and his illness was a little better. On the third morning, "咚! 咚! 咚!" Who knocked on the window? Mom opened the window. It turned out to be wind. Fenger said, "I'm here to play with you. I'll let your wind chimes ring!" The chimes rang "tinkering". The chubby Bobo sang a song with the wind chimes, and his illness was a little better. Now Fenger is carrying flowers every day, turning the windmill "Da La Da La", and shaking the wind chime "Ding Ling Ding Ling" to play with the little chubby Bobo. Its illness is all right! Mom opened the window, it turned out to be windy.
