Rat meeting! One day, the kitten would build the house next to the mouse 's house, and the kitten and the mouse became neighbors. A kitten is the enemy of a mouse. This can hardly damage the mouse. The mouse hates and fears the little cat. Now it is a neighbor. The mouse is afraid to go out all day. What can we do? King Rat thought and thought, and finally came up with a solution. So he called the mice together for a meeting to discuss how to deal with cats. King Mouse suggested that everyone hang a bell on the cat's neck. In this way, as soon as the cat comes out, the mice will know. But who can hang the bell? Everyone wants to come and go. In the end, the King Mouse sent an elf capable mouse Mimi to complete this sacred task. Unfortunately, the mouse Mimi was killed by the cat. Since then, the mouse is even more afraid of the cat. In the end, the King Mouse sent an elf capable mouse Mimi to complete this sacred task.
