Little Monkey makes a call A little monkey has a phone installed in his house. He thinks: It's so convenient to invite friends to be a guest at home now. He picked up the phone on the table and started dialing. Dial the white rabbit's phone number first, and said, "Hey, is it a three-flap mouth?" Little White Rabbit was angry with him. He called Piggy's house again: "Is it a fat piggyball house?" Piggy ignored him. When the monkey mother saw it, she said to the monkey: "It 's too impolite for you to call. You don't know how to respect others. How can others come to be a guest?" Hearing, he lowered his head in shame. Little Monkey makes a call A little monkey has a phone installed in his house.
