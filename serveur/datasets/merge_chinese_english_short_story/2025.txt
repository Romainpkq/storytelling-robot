Asking for directions The little white rabbit got lost in the forest. I walked back and forth and went back to my old place. I couldn't go home. A little squirrel peels pine cones from the tree. The little white rabbit asked, "Brother Squirrel, my family lives in Beishan. Where can I go?" The little squirrel said: "On a cloudy day, you can't see the sun. If you look for the north in the forest, look at the trunk. The rough bark side is North. "The little white rabbit walked out of the forest, and it was already dark. Where is North? The owl was waiting to catch field voles on the tree. He asked the owl, "Aunt Owl, may I ask, where is the north?" The owl said, "If you want the north at night, look for the Big Dipper first, and then look at the North Star." Going, he walked all night. At dawn, a sika deer drinking water by the river, the little white rabbit asked, "Sister Sika, where is the north?" Sika said, "If you look for the north in the daytime, look at the sun. In the morning, the sun is on your right, and in front of you is North, in the afternoon, the sun is on your left, and your front is also north. "The little white rabbit walked as the sika deer said, and found her home. The little white rabbit walked according to the sika deer, and she found her home.
