The funny nose-sticking game The nose-sticking game is really interesting. During extracurricular activities, the teacher drew a big head doll with no nose on the blackboard in the classroom. Let us stick her nose. It was our turn to stick the nose to the big head doll. The first one to go up was Xiao Jun. The leader of the team blindfolded him with green silk and helped him turn around three times. Xiao Jun walked slowly to the blackboard with a red nose and compared it for a while. Stick your nose. Before Xiao Jun pulled off the ribbon, the students laughed. It turned out that I put my nose on my right eye.
