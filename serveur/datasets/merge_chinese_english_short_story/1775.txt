As long as the water is not rushing, the environment can be quieter. When the fish sleeps, its body is motionless, and its gills breathe slowly and gently. The eyes are always open, because the fish has no eyes or faces. Different fish sleep differently. Pufferfish, loach and other loves sleep at night; flounder and tiger sharks love to sleep during the day; tuna and swordfish, etc. do not have a fixed time, and often sleep while swimming!
