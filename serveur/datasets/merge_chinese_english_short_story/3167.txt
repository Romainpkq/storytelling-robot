The stars in the sky in the autumn night are the best time to watch the stars. Look, how many bright stars hang in the dark blue sky! How beautiful their colors are: red, blue, yellow, white ... Just like precious gems. Stars and names. These stars are like a singing and dancing fairy called Andromeda; those stars are like a tall horse called Pegasus. There are also Mercury, Mars, Saturn ... constellation as much as the stars in the sky!
