Winter has passed, and spring came to me unconsciously. Spring is on the branches. The buds quietly drilled out and dressed the branches green. Spring is in the garden. The flowers are blooming, there are red, pink, and golden ... colorful, so beautiful! The most attractive thing is the pansies, like a group of flowers and butterflies spreading their wings, dancing. In the vast fields in spring, broad beans and rapeseeds planted by the farmer's uncle have worked hard to produce small white and golden flowers, exuding a burst of fragrance. Spring is here, the motherland is full of spring, I love the spring of the motherland.
