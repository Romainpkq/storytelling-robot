Little bears, I look forward to the New Year, I can eat New Year's Eve, I can get small gifts, and I have new clothes for the New Year. I hope I ca nâ€™t reach it, so anxious that the bears will turn around. I pat my head so hard that the calendar turns slowly. Since then a few pages a day, the calendar has just turned summer. I pat my head so hard that the calendar turns slowly.
