If I were a snowflake, if I were a snowflake, when winter came, I would cover the crops with a quilt. If I were a snowflake, when the spring flowers bloom, I would turn it into spring water to irrigate the soil. If I were a snowflake, I would freeze the pests and make the earth clean and tidy. If I were a snowflake, I would dance around the children. Bring them joy. I would like to make a snowflake!
