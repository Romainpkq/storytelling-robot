Plants also have to sleep. Everyone knows that people and animals must sleep, but many plants also have to sleep. Under the sunshine of the red clover, three small leaves spread out on each petiole, appearing refreshed; at night, the three small leaves are closed together, as if the eyes are closed. In the sunny day, the family stretches out the leaves and looks happy, the night falls, the leaves are joined together in pairs, and they have a good night's sleep. The water lily, when the morning of the day came, slowly opened its petals, revealing a charming smile. As the sun sets, the water lily gradually closes its petals and enters dreamland. Plants sleep, some can prevent freezing, and some can reduce the loss of heat and moisture. From this point of view, plants, like humans, need to sleep.
