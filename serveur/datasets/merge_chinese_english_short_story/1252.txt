The beautiful flower bed has a rectangular flower bed in the northwest corner of our school playground. In the center of the flowerbed, there are several tall "canna" with a high fragrance. Its dark green leaves are like a green banana fan. Its straight and upright stem, dragging a few gorgeous crimson flowers, much like a slim girl standing there! On both sides of the flower bed, there were two pomegranate trees. They seemed to be two guards guarding the flower bed day and night. Around the flower bed, there are many potted flowers, such as the icy winter that is not afraid of the cold, the pink rose, the green spider plant, and the beautiful begonia. It is really beautiful! The flower bed in the school is so beautiful! The beautiful flower bed has a rectangular flower bed in the northwest corner of our school playground.
