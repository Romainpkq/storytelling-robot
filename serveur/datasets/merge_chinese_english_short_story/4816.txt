Children who count stars at night, the stars in the sky are like countless pearls scattered in the jasper plate. A child sat in the yard, leaning on her grandmother, raised her head and pointed to the sky to count the stars. One, two, counted to hundreds. The grandmother said with a smile: "Stupid boy, counting the stars again. So many stars, flickering and blinking, all eyes are blooming, can you count them?" The child said, "Grandma, can see You can count them when you see them. The stars are moving, but not turbulent. You see, this star is always so far away from that star. "Grandpa came over and said," Child, you see very well Be careful. The stars in the sky are moving, but the distance between them seems to be constant. Our ancestors divided them into groups and gave them names. "Grandpa stopped, pointing to the north The sky said, "Look, the seven stars, connected like a spoon, are called the Big Dipper. The star facing the spoon is the North Star. The Big Dipper always rotates around the North Star." Grandpa said is that true? The child didn't sleep well all night, and looked up at the stars several times. He saw clearly, the Big Dipper really turned slowly around the North Star. This child who counts stars is called Zhang Heng, who is from the Han Dynasty. After he grew up, he worked hard on astronomy and became a famous astronomer.
