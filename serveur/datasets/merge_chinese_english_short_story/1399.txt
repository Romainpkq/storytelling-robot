Blowing bubbles When I was young, I played a lot of games. One of my favorite games was blowing soap bubbles. In the rainy season, we can't go to the mountains and the seaside to play, our mother taught us to blow soap bubbles on the porch. She said that in rainy seasons, the weather is humid and soap bubbles are not easy to break. We put the leftover soap in a small wooden bowl, added a little water, and made and dissolved it to dissolve it. Then use a thin bamboo tube, dipped in the thick soapy water, and slowly blow it into a light and round bubble. A gentle mention again, the light round ball fell from the bamboo tube and slowly floated in the air. If you fan them gently with a fan below, they can sometimes fly very high. This soap bubble is very beautiful, with five colors of light floating around on the clear and transparent sphere. If it is well fanned, a large ball will also split into two or three exquisite small balls, scattered all over the place. Sometimes the blow is too big and the fan is too hurry. The fragile ball will be pulled long and round, trembling, and the light will be scattered. At this time, everyone was hanging their heads, holding their heads up, and holding their breath-before long, the multicolored thin ball broke apart silently, and turned into soapy water, and water drops spilled into our eyes. Everyone hurriedly lowered their heads and rubbed their eyes, tears came out. The individual balls were blown out carefully and carefully by ourselves. They flew up gently, so round, so free, so transparent, so beautiful. By the breeze of the fan, they flew to the sky one by one, gently next to the bright moon, crossed the Tianhe River, and went west with the setting sun. Or drifting across the sea lightly, flying over the mountains ... Watching them, our hearts are filled with joy, pride and hope. A gentle mention again, the light round ball fell from the bamboo tube and slowly floated in the air.
