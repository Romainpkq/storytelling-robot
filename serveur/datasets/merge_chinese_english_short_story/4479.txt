"Jimmy" "I like to take a walk. After dinner every day, I love to walk around the door. At every recent walk, I always see a white dog with a white coat. I often hear its owner call it" Jimmy. " Little "Jimmy" has aura, every time I see me, I always look excited, as if I see an old friend, naughtily wandering around me, and often raising my front paws to greet me. As long as I squatted down and gently stroked its soft hair, it would lie there motionlessly, so gentle. Little "Jimmy" jumped immediately when he heard the master's shout, and returned to the master obediently. I have always liked dogs, but since I met Little Jimmy, I really want to have a little dog like this too!
