Two swallows made nests under the eaves. They kept mulling back and forth, the little cock raised his head and asked, "Sister Swallow, are you happy?" The swallow said, "We will have our own home right away, very happy." The little cock asked Aunt Sika: "Aunt Sika Everyone is happy, what is happiness? "Aunt Sika said:" Child, happiness needs to be found by yourself, happiness comes from everything in life, happiness is in everyone's heart. "The ant replied:" Our winter food is almost ready, and we are very happy.
