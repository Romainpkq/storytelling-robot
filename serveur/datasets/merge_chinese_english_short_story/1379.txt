Among the colorful frames in the Children's Art Exhibition, I saw a picture without color and extremely simple lines. It was a picture of a blind child. On the white paper, a sun was drawn with a ballpoint pen, shining on a small house. There was a stream in front of the small house, and a tall tree. A few strokes sketched a peaceful and happy family. Everyone who passes by here will stop and carefully look at this extremely simple painting without color for so long. Not only did they look at this picture, they seemed to see the mind of the blind child through this picture.
