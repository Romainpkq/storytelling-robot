The kitten is a small cat with black and white hair all over it. Its small and exquisite face has a pair of bright eyes. These two eyes are blue in the morning and yellow at noon, and in the evening they turn green again, like two glowing light bulbs. It also pays great attention to hygiene. In the morning, it stretches and stretches its lazy waist, licks its hair with its tongue, and uses its paws to wash its face. Then it finds a warmer place, and rests with its eyes closed. These two eyes are blue in the morning and yellow at noon, and in the evening they turn green again, like two glowing light bulbs.
