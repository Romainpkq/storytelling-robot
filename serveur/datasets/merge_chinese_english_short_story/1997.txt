White mushrooms thunder, a shower, and beautiful woods with water pearls. A big mushroom was drilled out of the green and lovely grass. The whole body of the big mushroom is white and snowy, fresh and smooth like the petals of a pear flower. The round head looks like an open umbrella, and it looks like a stand on a pillar. The golden sun shone on it, twinkling with radiance. Wow ! What a beautiful white mushroom. The praying mantis jumped up and said loudly, "I will play a big knife under the white mushroom, and I will not get sweaty." The white mushroom cried, "Don't! Don't! What do you do with a big knife that hurts me?" Gently said, "The white mushroom is timid, don't scare it. Practice the knife beside me!" The praying mantis lowered its head and walked away. I ran over and shouted, "I want to stand on the top of white mushrooms and sing. What a beautiful stage!" White mushrooms cried, "No, no! What do you do if you step on it?" Qing Cao said enthusiastically: "Come, stand on my green leaves and sing!" 蟋蟀 blinked, and left. The little ant came over and said, "At night, I sat under the big umbrella of the white mushroom and listened to the music played by the children. The dew wouldn't wet my clothes." The white mushroom pouted and said, "No Well! No one is allowed to approach me. "Everyone looked at the white mushroom in astonishment, silent. Qing Cao said enthusiastically, "Come, stand on my green leaves and sing!"
