The beautiful bear planted a lot of flowers in the polluted bear. The scent in the yard was fragrant. The puppy wanted to buy a pot. On the 5th day, the bear put a pot of potted flowers on a tricycle, and the wooden sign "Recycle used batteries and send you a potted plant" was also inserted on it. The puppy understood that today is World Environment Day, and the bear protects the environment, and I want to participate. Ding Lingling, the tricycle wore alleys, crossed the street, and the puppy ran and yelled, "Beautiful for pollution, flowers for waste batteries!" The kittens and rabbits went out after hearing that, put down the waste batteries, and took away a pot of flowers. When Aunt Monkey arrived with a basket of waste batteries, the flowers had been delivered. Aunt Monkey said with a smile, "It doesn't matter. Caring for the environment is caring for our lives."
