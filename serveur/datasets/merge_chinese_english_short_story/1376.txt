Wu Mi borrowed books. Wu Mi, a famous historian, often walked dozens of miles to the book collectors in the county when he was a teenager. Sometimes when he borrowed a book, he read while walking, and halfway through the book, after reading the book, he returned the same way, sent the book back and borrowed another. Once, Wu Xuan borrowed a copy of "Liao Zhai Zhi Yi" and said that after reading it for three months, who would have returned the book on the fifth day. The collector was dubious, and selected several stories from the book for him to tell. Wu Mi told it accurately, and the collector nodded again and again.
