Flies and mosquitoes were flying on the garbage dump. I don't know where they came from again. Flies and mosquitoes chatted on the stinky garbage dump. The fly said loudly, "Hey, little mosquito, we have a great family of flies. We all have two names. When we were young, we called tadpoles. When we grew up, we called flies." The mosquito smiled and said sharply, "I thought What ’s so great about you, do n’t you have two names? Let me tell you, our mosquito family also has two names. It ’s called a maggot when we were young, and it ’s called a mosquito when we grow up. ”The fly said happily with its hand:“ Haha, Awesome! We both have two names. The "radar" spray pointed at them and "bounced" twice, and the mosquito flies were all dead. The flies said loudly, "Hey, little mosquitoes, our flies family is amazing, We all have two names, a cricket when we were young, and a fly when we grew up.
