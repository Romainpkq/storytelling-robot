The woodpecker and the tree were on the green grass, and a big tree called out, "Don't move me! Don't move me! I hurt!" "Mr. Tree, you are sick, I'm catching insects for you!" Said the woodpecker sincerely. "It's an insult! I'm young and strong, where's the bug on me? I know, this is just an excuse to hit me and hurt me. Warning, don't play tricks in front of me, get away!" The tree roared angrily . The woodpecker flew away embarrassedly. Since then, no more woodpecker has been willing to help this tree pecking. A few years later, there were more worms in the tree, and this "young and strong" tree finally turned into empty waste in the belly. Since then, no more woodpecker has been willing to help this tree pecking.
