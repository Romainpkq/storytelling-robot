The vegetables in the vegetable garden have grown up. Mother Bear took the bear to collect the vegetables. They walked into the turnip field, and Mother Bear pulled out a big turnip. The bear will eat the leaves of the radish. Mother Bear said: Don't eat the leaves, eat the roots. Remember, the roots of radish are the most delicious. They walked into the cabbage field, and Mother Bear pulled out a cabbage. The bear will eat the roots of cabbage. Mother Bear said: Remember, the roots of cabbage are not delicious, but the leaves are delicious! They walked into the tomato field, and the bear wanted to eat the leaves of the tomato.
