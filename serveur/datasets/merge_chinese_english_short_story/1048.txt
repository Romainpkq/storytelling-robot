The hands of Grandpa Earth and the little monkey and bunny are good friends. One day, they were playing under the tree, jumping, singing, so happy! After playing for a while, the little monkey said, "Rabbit, I invite you to eat peaches." Yeah, the peaches on the tree are big and red. They must be delicious. The little monkey said to the monkey father who was on the tree, "Daddy, would you please pick some peaches for us, okay?" The father monkey didn't answer, and didn't take any action. I saw a few peaches falling from the tree by themselves. The little rabbit said, "Uncle Monkey, thank you!" The monkey father smiled and said, "Don't thank me, this is the help of Grandpa Earth." The little monkey felt strange: "How can Grandpa Earth help?" Little Rabbit also said : "Yeah, how can Grandpa Earth help? He has no hands." Grandpa Earth spoke: "No, I have a hand, and I have a lot of strength, so that ripe peaches can fall down, and they can be kicked. The football in the air fell ... my hand is the gravity that you can't see. "Grandpa Earth had just finished, and a few peaches fell from the tree again. "The monkey father hadn't answered it and didn't take any action. I saw a few peaches falling from the tree by themselves.
