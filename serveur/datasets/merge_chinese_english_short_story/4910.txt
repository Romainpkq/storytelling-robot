The Mid-Autumn Festival is here, osmanthus blossoms, and the sweet smell of osmanthus is everywhere in the community. Step forward and look closely, you will find clusters of golden-yellow osmanthus in the green leaves. Each little flower has four small petals, which are very cute. As soon as the wind blew, the little osmanthus flies down, and the golden osmanthus rained down. Dad told me that osmanthus has different colors. The golden ones are called Jin Gui, the silver ones are called Yin Gui, and the orange ones are called Dan Gui.
