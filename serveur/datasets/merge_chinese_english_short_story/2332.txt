When he cut a wall and stole the Western Han Dynasty, there was a peasant's child called Kuang Heng. His family was very poor and had no money to go to school, but he also loved reading and had to work and earn money to read. One day, Kuang Heng thought: I planted crops during the day and didn't have time to read books. I could use some more nights to read books. But Kuang Heng's family is so poor that he can't afford the oil for lighting. What should I do? Kuang Heng was lying on the bed carrying the book he had read during the day and carrying it on his back. Suddenly he saw a beam of light shining through the eastern wall. He immediately stood up and walked over to the wall to see, ah! It turned out that the light from the neighbor 's house was seeping through the crack in the wall. So Kuang Heng thought of a solution: he took a small knife and dug a little wall gap. In this way, the light that passed through was even brighter, and he used it to read the book. Kuang Heng studied hard like this, and later became a very learned person. So Kuang Heng thought of a solution: he took a small knife and dug a little wall gap.
