Animals on land make various sounds. "Wang Wangwang" is a dog barking, "Mimi Mimi" is a cat barking, "Boo Biao Biao" is a sheep barking, "Woo Woo Woo" is a rooster barking. The yellow warbler's cry sounds like singing, and the parrot will learn to talk to people. The fish in the ocean can be called like the animals on land. You hear, it's the sound of octopus, melodious like a piano, lionfish makes "haha" laughter, and balloon fish also makes a "huff" sound, as if the sleeping person is snoring.
