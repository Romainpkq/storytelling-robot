Little Raindrops Little Raindrops are a group of lovable little dolls. They are sensible and most willing to help people. If the little flowers are thirsty, the little raindrops will jump from the sky and let the little flowers absorb the rain. If the fish in the lake feels sulky, they jump down and blow bubbles out of the water to make the fish breathable.
