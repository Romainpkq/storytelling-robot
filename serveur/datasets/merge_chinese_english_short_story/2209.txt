Mr. Ma Hu Once upon a time, there was a painter. One day, he had just painted a tiger's head, and a friend came to ask him to paint a horse. He added a horse body to the tiger's head painting, and the friend stopped the painting. The painter hung the painting on the wall of his own home. From then on, people called him "sloppy painter". One day, his eldest son went out hunting, saw a horse, thought it was a tiger, and shot the horse with an arrow, but was beaten; the younger son saw a tiger in the wild, and thought it was a horse, and wanted to ride It was eaten by the tiger. Mr. Sloppy cried a lot, and determined that he would take things seriously in the future and stop being sloppy. The younger son saw a tiger in the wild and thought it was a horse. He wanted to ride on it, but was eaten by the tiger.
