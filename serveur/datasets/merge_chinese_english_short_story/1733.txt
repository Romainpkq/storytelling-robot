"Lazy" Dad I am the "little princess" in the family, and my parents care for me like stars. Grandma spoiled me, for fear I was hungry, frozen, and tired; my mother was accustomed to me, for fear of being wronged. Only Dad has been ignoring me recently. What's going on? In the past, when I did an assignment that I couldn't do, as long as I asked my father, he would definitely tell me the answer. But during these days, I found out that my dad became "lazy" and asked no questions. Sometimes I looked at me sternly. When I asked again, he said, "I read the book to find the answer." I had to read the book to check the information. Although the answer was found, it took me a lot of time, but every time I found the answer, I would feel the faint smile in my father 's eyes. Today, I encountered a problem I had never seen before, and I did not do it with all my brains. I had to ask my father, "Dad, I have never seen this question before, can you teach me?" My heart pounded, lest my father refused me. Dad glanced at me and said, "Have you checked the book?" I replied, "There are no questions of this type in the book." "You do other homework first." After that, Dad went into the room. I had to go back to my room. After a while, Dad took a book and came to my room. The book clearly stated the answer. He explained it to me carefully and told me to do it again. After I finished the question, I flipped through the small book and found that there were records on the questions I had asked before. I finally learned the reason why Dad became "lazy". He used a stern, ignorant attitude to cultivate my ability to think independently and solve problems. He expressed his passionate and sincere love for children in a unique way. In the past, when I did an assignment that I couldn't do, as long as I asked my father, he would definitely tell me the answer.
