Naughty colorful light The sun-grandfather has seven naughty light babies. Their names are red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. Colorful light babies drilled in the clouds and dyed the clouds in the sky into colorful clouds. Enough they had played in the sky, they slipped secretly to the ground to play, they slipped onto the sunflower, and the sunflower's face became golden golden. They came to the orchard again and clothed oranges. They ran on the grass and rolled, and the grass turned green. They jumped, jumped, and jumped into the sea, and the sea became blue. After the colorful baby has taken a bath and passed the beach, the little crab asks that they are coming in cyan, and they have become a little blue crab. As soon as the colorful baby came to the vegetable garden, the father-in-law of the sun called them home. Tomatoes and eggplants are in a hurry: "Leave us beautiful colors!" The colorful baby kisses tomatoes and eggplants. Tomatoes have a red color, and eggplants have a purple color. When the colorful baby heard the father-in-law of the sun shouting again, he hurried to the sky, and there was a colorful glow in the place where they ran. They jumped, jumped, and jumped into the sea, and the sea became blue.
