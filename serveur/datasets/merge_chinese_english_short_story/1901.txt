One winter, Lenin was nourishing in the suburbs. He goes for a walk in the park every day. There is a tall birch tree in the park. There are three greyfinches on the tree: two breasts are pink, and one breast is crimson. They bounce back and forth between the branches and sing gently, which is very cute. Every time Lenin walked under the birch tree, he stopped and looked up at the three cheerful greyfinches, and often brought them breadcrumbs and grains.
