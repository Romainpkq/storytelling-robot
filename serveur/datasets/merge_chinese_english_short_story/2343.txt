As soon as the tulips in Meiyuan entered Meiyuan, the flowers of various colors nodded and said hello to us. The grass seemed more vibrant in the drizzle. Going forward, there is a picture scroll in front of us. The float is connected to the float, and the flower bed is connected to the flower bed. We are immersed in the sea of ​​flowers, the most beautiful of which is the tulip. How many colors of tulips! There are fiery reds, there are golden ones, there are snow-white ones ... it's all colors. The blooming tulips, one by one, clumps, and pieces, you are next to me, and I am next to you, in the drizzle blooming more joyfully. I leaned down and looked closely at the tulip. Its flowers really looked like a lovely little wine glass, standing on a straight flower stem. The wide green leaves of the tulips are facing the sky, and even the flowers are facing the sky. It seems that the fairies who have fallen from the sky are looking forward to which day they can return to the kingdom of heaven. Blowing slightly, thousands of tulips swayed in the wind, like dancing in fairy costumes. The scent of the tulips is not strong, but as soon as you get closer to the smell, bursts of fragrance will come out. Ah, the tulips are so beautiful! It is indeed the national flower of the Netherlands! I leaned down and looked closely at the tulip. Its flowers really looked like a lovely little wine glass, standing on a straight flower stem.
