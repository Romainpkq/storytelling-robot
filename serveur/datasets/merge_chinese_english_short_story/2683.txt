Spring is here spring is here, spring is here. The earth gradually woke up from sleep. The flowers showed sweet smiles. The birds sang beautiful songs. The children lined up in a neat line and went to the spring tour happily. Spring is really a beautiful and lovely season. Spring is really a beautiful and lovely season.
