Three monks have said that in ancient times, a lively and clever young monk came to a temple on the mountain. At the beginning, he diligently picked water. Not only was he enough to drink, he also poured water into the net bottle in the hands of the Bodhisattva, and the willow branches in the net bottle were alive. Soon a thin monk came. He had a dispute with the young monk over the issue of drinking water and picking up water. No one was willing to suffer, so the two discussed to lift water together. Later, another fat monk came. All three monks want to drink water, but they are not willing to pick more water. Within two days the tank had bottomed out. The willow branches in the clear bottle also began to wither due to lack of water. One night, while the three monks were snoring, a burning candle fell on the incense case, and the little temple caught fire. During the crisis, three monks scrambled to pick up water to fight the fire, and a fire was quickly put out. After the fire, the three monks seemed to understand something. From then on, the water in the water tank was full again. The three monks cheerfully held large bowls to drink water, and the willow branches in the net bottle were restored to life. The willow branches in the clear bottle also began to wither due to lack of water.
