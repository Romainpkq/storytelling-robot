The proud tiger tiger and the little white rabbit will hold a race and let the little dog be the referee. At the beginning of the game, the tiger ran all the way. Looking back to see that the little white rabbit had fallen off by himself, he said to the little white rabbit: "Let me sleep afterwards and run with you!" Sleeping on the ground. The little white rabbit kept running forward, getting closer and closer to the tiger, and the puppy next to him shouted the tiger: "Little white rabbit catches up!" The tiger opened his eyes and said, "It's okay, it can't catch up. I! "So, it closed its eyes and fell asleep again. The little white rabbit continued to run forward, almost to the end. The puppy shouted the tiger anxiously: "Little white rabbit is coming to the end." At this time, the tiger quickly got up and chased forward, but it was too late. The little white rabbit crossed the end. The tiger lost the game, and the puppy said to it, "You are so proud!" The tiger lowered his head in shame.
