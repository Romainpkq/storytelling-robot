Once upon a time, a couple opened a hotel, and because of the cheap wine they sold, the business was booming. One day, when the husband went out, the wife secretly mixed water with the wine and sold it for five yuan more. At night when the husband came back, the wife proudly told her "secret" that she would get her compliment. Who knew that her husband was so angry that his feet were so straight that he cried with headache. While crying, he told his wife that the most precious thing is to talk about credibility. You sold our most valuable thing with only 5 yuan of credibility. Sure enough, their business was not as prosperous as before, and finally finally broke completely. When his wife was impoverished and dying, she wept with regret and said, "I see ..." While crying, he said to his wife that the most precious thing is to talk about credibility, and you put our most valuable thing in credibility Five yuan was sold.
