During the summer in the zoo, my dad took me to the zoo to play. There are many animals in the zoo. The most attractive is the giraffe. The giraffe has yellow spots on its body and a short tail, but its neck is long enough to reach a high place. The giraffe was poor at feeding when he was a child. When he grows up, his neck grows, and his ability to gather leaves becomes higher. It likes to eat fresh leaves most, you see how fragrant it is! There are many animals in the zoo.
