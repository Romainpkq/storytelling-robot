In the early winter morning of the mist girl, the mist girl came flying with a white veil. She came to a beautiful garden and covered the flowers with layers of white veil. The flowers said, "Thank you, Mist Girl, we are thirsty, and you sent us nectar." Mist Girl came to the winding road again, and she thought, "Let me dress up the road." She covered the white gauze one by one on the highway. He thought the highway was more beautiful. But the highway said, "Mist girl, don't do this, the sister of the car will have an opinion." Sure enough came the voice of the sister of the car: "Mist girl, your kindness will make me invisible to the road, you still go back!" Mist The girl was upset, crying hummingly, and her tears fell to the ground. At this time, the father-in-law came out. He stretched out two warm big hands and wiped away the tears for the misty girl, comforting her and said, "Child, you should rest!" The misty girl was holding the white veil and drifted away with a smile. She covered the white gauze one by one on the highway. He thought the highway was more beautiful.
