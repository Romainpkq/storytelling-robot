The morning glory girl wearing a flower for the mother-in-law of the tree just wanted to climb up. She lifted her neck and looked at an old tree in front of her: "It's pitiful, there isn't even a green leaf on the dead branch." "Mother-in-law, why don't you grow green leaves?" The morning glory girl asked. Grandma Tree whispered, "I'm old and won't grow up!" "No, you'll grow green leaves!" Said the morning glory girl loudly. As she stretched her body, she kept climbing to Mother-in-law tree: "Look, how beautiful the world is, you mother-in-law, you should dress up!" "I'm useless, what else should I dress up!" Mother-in-law, I'll help you dress up. "The morning glory climbed hard and climbed very high, and purple flowers bloomed in the green leaves, and was worn on the tree-in-law's head and body. Tree Mother-in-law is very happy. She was trembling with energy, and she had strength all over her. As a result, she had grown new branches and tender leaves. "Thank you, Morning Glory," said Grandma Shu, "you gave me flowers and you gave me confidence." Morning Glory was also very happy, and she played a beautiful piece of music with a small trumpet. In autumn, the morning glory girl is already asleep. She was in the arms of Mother-in-law, and slept soundly and sweetly. "No, you will grow green leaves!"
