The beautiful lotus pond "Xiao He only showed sharp and pointed corners, and dragonflies have long stood up." This is a poem I recited before. I didn't really see this scene until I came to the pond. A pool of turquoise lotus leaves squeezed next to each other and swayed gently in the breeze. On the lotus leaf, there were glittering dew drops, which slipped into the water from time to time. Blossoming lotus flowers emerged from the large disc-shaped lotus leaves, and some were shyly wrapped in flower-bone flowers, while others bloomed pink petals, exposing yellow flower stamens, exuding tempting Fragrance. The dragonfly sister has long been intoxicated by the beauty in front of her eyes. She flutters her wings and sometimes stays on this lotus leaf for a while to stop and admire. Sometimes she smells the fragrance on that lotus flower. She can't help but admire: "Beautiful lotus!" I'm sorry to say, "I can't be beautiful without my sister's backing!" The lotus girl is embarrassed to say, "I can't be beautiful without my sister's backing!"
