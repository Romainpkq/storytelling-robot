It's raining in summer. Summer rain came when it came. The colorful umbrellas formed a lot of wet flowers in the rain. The world in the rain is like a crystal lake. Groups of children playing with umbrellas play in the transparent rain, like fish in the lake, playing hide and seek under the lotus leaf.
