Once upon a time, there was a little ant who wanted to cross the river, but there was no bridge or boat. What should I do? It thought about it and finally came up with a good way. One day, the little ant came to the river, climbed under a big tree not far from the river, and saw the leaves on the tree were very big. He thought, "How can I get the leaves down?" At this moment, a squirrel shouted on the tree: "Little ant, what are you standing under the tree?" The ant hurriedly looked up, and it turned out to be a squirrel. It was so happy that he yelled, "Brother Squirrel, can you pick a leaf for me?" The squirrel was willing to help others, so she picked a large, thick leaf and threw it away. The little ant said happily, "Thank you, Brother Squirrel." The little ant dragged this large and thick leaf, and it took the power of nine tigers and two tigers to drag the leaf to the river. The little ant carefully placed it on the river and took himself on a boat made of leaves as if he was swinging slowly. That day happened to be a good wind, and after a while, the boat swayed across the river. In this way, the little ant crossed the river in peace. The little ant was willing to use his brain and was praised by the little friends. "The squirrel was happy to help others, so it picked a big, thick leaf and threw it down.
