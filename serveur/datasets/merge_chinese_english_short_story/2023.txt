The dense forests of our homes are the homes of the little birds, and the little birds are singing in the mountains. The clear river is the home of the fish, and the fish are playing in the river. The vast grassland is the home of cattle and sheep, and cattle and sheep run freely on the grassland. The rich earth is our home, and we thrive on the earth. Take care of our home, take care of their home, and make all homes beautiful! The dense forests of our homes are the homes of the little birds, and the little birds are singing in the mountains.
