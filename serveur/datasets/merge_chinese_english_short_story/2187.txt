Qi Baishi is a famous painter in China. He cherishes time very much, never wastes time, and always insists on himself with the phrase "don't teach a day to spare". Once, Qi Baishi had his 90th birthday. He was too late to send the last guests away. At this time he thought that the task of painting today has not been completed yet, and he should finish painting before going to bed, so he took up his pen to paint. Only after his family repeatedly discouraged him went to rest. The next day, Qi Baishi got up early, and his family was afraid that he would be tired, so he advised him to take a rest, but he insisted on making up the five paintings of yesterday. Once, Qi Baishi had his 90th birthday.
