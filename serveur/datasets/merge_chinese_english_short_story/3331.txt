The fruit is ripe in the orchard. Apples are blushing like dolls; yellow persimmons are covered with branches; pomegranates also playfully grin their small mouths and smile at us. Look at the oranges, they are all round and chubby, watching the children's games on the branches, they also want to come down and play!
