I saw the woodpecker Saturday and Sunday. My father and mother took me to the Shanghai Botanical Garden to visit the newly built "Tropical Botanical Museum". It was noon after visiting the "Lanyuan" and "Bonsai Garden". We found a towering tree. Under the shade of the tree, my father and mother laid out plastic cloth. We sat on the ground and prepared for a picnic. Soon, there was a "tuk tuk" sound like knocking a wooden fish. I didn't take it seriously at first, but with the sound came a burst of wood chips, sprinkled on our jam like pepper, and I thought someone was joking with us. I was wondering, the sound of "Tuk Tuk" was getting closer and closer. Listening carefully, the sound came from above our heads. When I looked up and looked up, I was overjoyed. A woodpecker was pecking hard at the hole, and soon a large worm was hooked. I saw it spread its wings and flew away after eating the worm. This tour of the Botanical Garden is really happy.
