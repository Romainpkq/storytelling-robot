In the scorching sun in the desert, the mother sand chicken was sick, and she lay down under a cactus and panted, saying, "Water, water ..." The mother sand chicken quickly helped her mother find water. It looked in the endless desert and finally found a small puddle. Xiaosha chicken was so happy that he could not afford to drink it, and quickly dipped his furry body into the puddle. The grouse's feathers have a strong ability to absorb water, and after a while they are full of water. It flew under the cactus and said, "Mom, I'll send you water!" The mother grouse stuck her mouth into the feather of the little grouse, and sucked the water into her mouth. The sand chicken mother smiled and said, "You are really a sensible child!" Little sand chicken said, "Mom, when I was a kid, you also gave me water like this!" The sand chicken's feathers have a strong ability to absorb water. I was full of water.
