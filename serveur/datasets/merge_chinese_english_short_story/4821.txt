There is a small river in my hometown. The river flows slowly around the village, and there are many trees on the river bank. In spring, the trees are full of peach blossoms, which looks like a fiery morning glow from afar. After the stone bridge, it is a green farmland. Hometown is so beautiful! I love my hometown!
