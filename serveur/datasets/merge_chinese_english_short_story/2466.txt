Little grass By the road, on the banks of the river, inconspicuous little grasses fill nature with life. In the spring, a slight spring breeze blew, and the grass and the newly waking partners danced cheerfully. As they dance, they grow with the spring breeze. In the summer, the sun scorches the earth. People come to the grass and sit on the grass. The grass is like a loving mother who holds people in her arms, so that the tired people can eliminate the fatigue brought by the heat. She never cares what people give, prefers to contribute to people. In the autumn, a cool breeze blew, and she suddenly became pale and thin. The cold wind brought winter here, and the roots of the grass had penetrated deeply into the soil. When spring came the next year, she got out of the soil again. People come to the grass and sit on the grass. The grass is like a loving mother who holds people in her arms, so that the tired people can eliminate the fatigue brought by the heat.
