There is a beautiful lake in my hometown called Swan Lake. It is said that many years ago, a group of swans lived here, hence the name. The lake is round, the lake is clear, and the green is shiny. There are dense trees around the lake. Among them, the weeping willow is noticeable. Under the breeze, the wicker dances against the wind, and you can see that the figure of Liu Liu is very beautiful. Under the tree is a piece of green grass, with yellow and blue flowers blooming on the grass. There is a beautiful little bridge on the lake, which makes Swan Lake even more beautiful. Oh, Swan Lake, the lake of my hometown, I love you!
