Bees and butterflies in the morning, the weather is particularly clear, the little bees said goodbye to their mother, went to the garden to gather honey. The flowers in the garden were scented, and the little bee was so happy that he sang buzzing while collecting honey. A butterfly flew over and said, "You are so ugly, little bee with bulging eyes. What else are you flying here? Go away!" The little bee heard that and returned home sadly. My mother saw it and asked, "Child, what's wrong with you?" The little bee said what the butterfly said. Mother said earnestly: "Child, you can't just look at your appearance, you have to see if you can help others "" The little bee nodded, and happily went to gather honey.
