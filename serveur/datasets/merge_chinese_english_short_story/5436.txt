There is such a little bear on a small desert island. The bear feels lonely and sleeps every day dreaming of playing with many friends. When the bear saw a cloud floating in the sky, he quickly asked, "Cloud, cloud, how can I find a friend?" Yuner didn't speak, and floated to a tree. The little bear understood that he planted and planted many small saplings on the island. In one or two years, the young saplings grew up, the mountains and the wild, and the green leaves became overcast. A little bird flew: "Ah, it's so nice here! I'll live here!" Many birds flew, and all lived here. In the distance, the little deer, the little elephant, the little monkey, all came in a row boat: "Ah, it's nice here! Let's live here!" The little bear was very happy and kept saying: "Welcome you !welcome!"
