The lotus leaf came the wind and the rain came, and the frogs hid under the lotus leaf. Every frog has a lotus leaf on its head. The rain hit the lotus leaves, and it clicked like a drum of joy. The frogs were so happy under the lotus leaf umbrella, and they danced with joy at a happy rhythm. The little fox ran past the lotus pond in the rain, and a frog stopped him: "Little fox, lend you this umbrella!" The little fox raised the lotus leaf umbrella. The raindrops hit the lotus leaves, rattling like a drum of joy. The little fox was very happy under the umbrella and danced with joy at a happy rhythm. Two little white rabbits ran past the lotus pond in the rain, and a frog stopped them: "Little white rabbit, lend you this umbrella!" Two little white rabbits raised a lotus leaf umbrella. The raindrops hit the lotus leaves, rattling like a drum of joy. The two little white rabbits and the drums of joy danced a joyous dance. The enthusiastic frogs also lent the lotus leaf umbrella to the chicks, cats and puppies. In the rain, there are small animals with lotus leafs everywhere, there are joyous drums everywhere, and there are joyous dances everywhere. Every frog has a lotus leaf on its head.
