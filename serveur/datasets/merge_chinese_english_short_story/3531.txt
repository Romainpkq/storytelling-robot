When the spring of the willows arrived, the shoots of the willows burst out and fluttered in the wind. Xiaofang and Xiaojun went to play in the park together. Seeing that the wicker is very beautiful, Xiaojun folded one of them and started playing. At this time, Xiaofang saw quickly and said: "The flowers and trees in the park were cultivated by the gardener Uncle. They are for everyone's appreciation. We must love it and not damage it." Xiao Jun said with ashamedness: "I won't pick flowers anymore in the future."
