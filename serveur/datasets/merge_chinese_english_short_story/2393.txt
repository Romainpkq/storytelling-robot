Good friends of crops-frogs There are many types of frogs. The common one is the black-spotted frog, which can reach 8 cm; the back is green with black markings; the abdomen is white as snow; the head is slightly triangular; there are a pair of protruding eyes on the top of the head, and the vision is sharp and can quickly detect flying Insects, but not sensitive to lying insects. There is a movable tongue in the mouth of the green frog. When preying, the tongue quickly flips out of the exit, sticks to the small insects, and gets caught in the mouth. The main food for frogs is agricultural pests such as moths, mosquitoes, flies and rice planthoppers. Therefore, the frog is known as a good friend of the crop. There are a pair of protruding eyes on both sides of the head, which are very sharp and can quickly find flying bugs, but they are not sensitive to lying bugs.
