The moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival The moon of the Mid-Autumn Festival is round. Mother said: "The round moon is like a plate." Dad said: "The round moon is like a flying saucer, followed by a group of small stars." I said: "No, no! The moon is like a big moon cake, very delicious, It ’s very sweet, and I ’ll give it to you. ”The moon listened to me and thought it would be eaten, and hurried into the cloud. After a while, it knew that we were eating moon cakes, and then drilled out and hung brightly in the sky.
