Song Lian likes to read when he was young, and had no money to buy books, so he had to borrow from others. Every time he borrowed a book, he always said the return date was good and returned it in time. Once, he borrowed a book, and the more he read it, the more he liked it, so he decided to copy it down. He copied the book all night, and his mother said: "Children, it's midnight. Let's copy it at dawn. People are not in a hurry to ask for a book." Song Lian said: "No matter what people are in a hurry, they will return the book when the deadline is reached. If you do nâ€™t talk about credit, how can you get respect from others. "
