On the tree in spring, tender buds grow; on the tree in summer, fat leaves hang; on the tree in autumn, the leaves are covered with bright red and golden; under the tree in winter, the leaves fall to the ground. Fallen leaves are the stamps of nature. They will be sent to you all year round, to me, to everyone.
