Autumn creepers There are many creepers under the porch behind the podium of our school. The creeper climbed along the wall and climbed up to the platform on the second floor. In summer, the green leaves of a wall all point downward, which is very beautiful. When autumn comes, the leaves of the creeper turn red, and the green wall turns into a red wall, which is even more beautiful. The bunches of red leaves are like autumn maple leaves, like piles of small flames, like red butterflies, and like the red sunset at that day. Under the mountain climbing tigers are blooming bright autumn chrysanthemums. All this became the brightest scenery in our school. We ran around under the eaves, playing freely, and the mountain climber made our happy smiles red. What a beauty ! Creeper in autumn. When autumn comes, the leaves of the creeper turn red, and the green wall turns into a red wall, which is even more beautiful.
