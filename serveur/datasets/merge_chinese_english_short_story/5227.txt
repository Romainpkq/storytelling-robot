Wiping the table On Sunday, after my family finished lunch, I said to my dad: "I will wipe the table today." Dad said: "Okay, but do n’t think it ’s a simple thing, but you need to do it well. Tips. "I said," You can rest assured that I will do a good job. "So, I packed the bowl and chopsticks into the sink, and then picked up a rag to wipe the table. I used a lot of energy to wipe it, but I didn't wipe it clean several times. Instead, I glued the vegetable scraps and some rice grains on the table to the table. Dad saw it, and said with a smile: "Xiaofan, the way you wipe is wrong, you should wipe in one direction, not in a circle." Dad said as he demonstrated. I wiped it again according to my father's instructions ... Soon, the dirty table was wiped clean by me, and it was as bright as a mirror. I can't think of learning how to clean the table. It seems that I really should do more housework!
