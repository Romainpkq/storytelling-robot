A horse lost its way in the desert. In the evening, the pony was tired and he thought, "If there is a drink of water, what a great thing!" Just then, it saw not far away, and there were some bright flowers on the stones. The pony rolled up a flower with his tongue, how sweet this flower is! "That 's all right!" The little horse cried happily, and ate all the flowers. The next day, the pony finally returned to his mother. The pony told her story to her mother and told her that she walked back because she ate the flowers that bloomed on the stones. The mother said with a smile: "Child, that's not a stone, it's a plant called a lithophyllum." "That's the case!" The pony understood. Just then, it saw not far away, and there were some bright flowers on the stones.
