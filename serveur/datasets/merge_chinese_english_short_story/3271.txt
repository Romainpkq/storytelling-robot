Planting Trees On the day of the tree planting festival on March 12th, the sun was shining brightly and the spring breeze was blowing. As soon as the students led the teachers to the suburbs, they began to divide and plant trees. Several classmates in the distance, some were digging pits with a shovel, some were supporting saplings, some were filling the soil, and some were watering, and they were doing a great job. The nearby Xiaoming and Xiaohong were divided into a group. At first, Xiaoming was responsible for digging the pit. The digging was done, but the digging didn't move. Dig harder or not. Ah! It turned out to be a big rock. He moved the rock out and continued to dig. The pit was finally dug. Xiaohong gently inserted the small sapling into the tree pit and carefully supported it. Xiao Ming slowly filled the soil Go in. After filling the soil, it was time to water. The two of them brought a bucket full of water and poured it on the roots to let the young saplings drink enough. Xiaoming and Xiaohong seem to be saying: "Small saplings, you grow up quickly, grow into towering trees early, and make beams for high-rise buildings." Little saplings also seem to say, "You are really good kids who love labor."
