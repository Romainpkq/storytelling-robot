The breeze in March whispered the good news to a cloud. The cloud carried many small raindrops. The raindrops crackled down and told the good news to a flower on the apple tree. When the little bee collecting honey heard the good news, he hummed a song and told each dandelion on the hill. Dandelion didn't say a word, their golden faces showed a smile in the sunlight after the rain. Now everyone knows the good news-spring is here.
