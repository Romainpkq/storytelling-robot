My little grandma is just getting sick. I'll accompany my grandma to bask in the sun. The sun is warm. I changed my grandma's magic, and a small orange was formed, and the round oranges were red, like a little sun. "Grandma, grandma, I peeled the oranges and we both ate. You have one, I have one; you have one, I have one." Grandma ate sweetly and warmed her heart. After eating the oranges, I said, "The little sun is gone!" Grandma hugged me, kissed my red face, and said to me, "This is my little sun."
