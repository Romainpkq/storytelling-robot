Who is the wisest to have a king give three sons one coin each. It is required to fill a room with the things bought. The eldest son bought a cart of wheat straw and did not fill the room. The second son bought a bag of yellow sand and spread it on the ground. He could only cover the floor of the room. The third son bought a candle and the lighted candle lit the whole room. You say, who is the smartest? The eldest son bought a cart of wheat straw and did not fill the room.
