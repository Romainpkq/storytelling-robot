Handkerchief On Sunday, I saw that the handkerchief covering the telephone was dirty, so I decided to wash it. I unscrewed the faucet, picked up a basin of water, put a handkerchief in the water to soak it, and then applied soap to it. Then I rubbed it vigorously with both hands, and I got a lot of foam. After rubbing it, I washed it again with clean water and wrung the handkerchief. Take a look and see! There was no stain on the handkerchief, just like the new one.
