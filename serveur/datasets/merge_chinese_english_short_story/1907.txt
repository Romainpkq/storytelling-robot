Sun flower I like the sun flower. It is one of the most common flowers in summer. The stems of sunflowers are red and green. The stem is very tender and it seems that water will come out with a stab in the hand. Sunflower leaves are very special. They are small and thick. The surface of the leaves looks like a thin layer of wax, which is smooth and green. The color of the sun flower is particularly bright, some are white as jade, some bright red as fire, and some golden as gold, and the pink is like a layer of faint rouge, the flowers are not large, and the multi-layered petals are naturally delicate The single-layered petals are so pretty, they are really flattering. I like the sun flower, not only because it is bright in color, but also because it has tenacious vitality. It is not afraid of the sun, wind and rain, so it always flourishes, just insert a small stem, insert In the soil, it will soon take root and bloom.
