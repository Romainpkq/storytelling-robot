Interesting sky Little sister stood at the window and looked up at the sky. There are several white clouds floating on the blue sky. One is like a goldfish, one is like a goat, and the other is like a white horse, and the largest one is like a white bear. The younger sister waved to them: "Dear friends, come and dance with me, okay?" The blue sky was fluttered with a few white clouds.
