My little hand I have a cute and capable little hand. Today, I quickly picked up the rag and “brushed, brushed, brushed” the table. Then, I washed the dishes, wiped the bowls and plates carefully, and then rinsed them again. Clean. Finally, it ’s time for me to sweep the floor. I swept and swept, and my mother saw me moving cleanly and laughed, and said, "You really missed the word by eight-good guys!" I was praised by my mother. A playful little frog bouncing in his heart. "I got the compliment from my mother, and I was so full of joy, as if there was a naughty little frog bouncing in my heart.
