I helped my mother wash the dishes for dinner, and I plan to help my mother wash the dishes. I first put water in the pool, poured a little dishwashing liquid, and stroked it with my hand. Many bubbles came out of the pool. Next, I soaked the bowl in the sink, gently washed the inside and outside of the bowl with a rag, then washed the edges of the bowl, and finally rinsed it off with clean water one by one. I picked up the bowl and rubbed it in my hand. The small bowl made a "creak" sound. Yeah, the bowl can still sing! I also hummed in a minor happily. I am very happy because I help my mother wash the dishes.
