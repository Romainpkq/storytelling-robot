A mother-loving little fish is a doll of the sea, he loves the mother of the sea; a little bird is a doll of the forest, he loves the mother of the forest; a little star is a doll of the blue sky, he loves the mother of the blue sky; He loves his motherland. The child is the doll of the motherland. He loves his mother.
