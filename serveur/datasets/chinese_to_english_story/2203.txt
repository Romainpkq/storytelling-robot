The little monkey didn't concentrate on listening in the math class. After school, he wouldn't be able to do math problems, so he ran to Lao Niu's house and said, "Hey! What's the problem with Lao Niu?" Lao Niu ignored it. After a while, the little rabbit also came to Lao Niu and said, "Uncle Niu, would you please tell me this question?" Lao Niu said patiently.
