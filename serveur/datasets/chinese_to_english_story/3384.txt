The big rooster blushed before dawn every day, the big rooster had to cry from the neck for a while. One day, his neighbor, the little rabbit, asked him: "Friend, why do you always call it, is it quieter to be better?" Said the big cock: "I don't call, the sky won't be bright!" The rabbit shook his head doubtfully. "Why, do you still doubt this?" Said the big cock in surprise: "Every day, always after I called, the genius is bright. Isn't that true?" The rabbit thought for a while and said: "So , Do n’t call it tomorrow morning, see what happens? ”The big cock agreed. The next day, the big cock didn't call. However, the sky is still bright. Self-righteous big cock, blushed with a brush.
