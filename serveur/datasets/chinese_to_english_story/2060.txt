In the colorful paintings of the children's art exhibition, I saw a painting with no color and extremely simple lines. It was a painting of a blind child. On the white paper, with a ball-point pen, a sun was drawn, shining on a hut. There was a stream in front of the hut, and a tall tree. A few strokes outlined a peaceful and happy family. Everyone who has walked here will stop and look at this extremely simple painting without color for so long. They not only looked at the picture, they seemed to see the mind of the blind boy through the picture.
