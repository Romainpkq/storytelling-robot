Mommy Plant has a way for Dandelion Mother to prepare a parachute and give it to her doll. As long as the wind blew gently, the children set off on the wind one after another. There is a good way for mother Xuan Er. She puts her child on a barbed armor. As long as the fur of the animal is hung, the children can go to the fields and mountains. Mother Pea had a better way. She let the pods shine in the sun. With a bang, the pods exploded, and the children bounced away from their mothers.
