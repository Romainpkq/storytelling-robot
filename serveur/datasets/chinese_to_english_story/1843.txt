Flies and mosquitoes fluttered a bunch of flies. I don't know where they came from again. Flies and mosquitoes chatted on the smelly garbage dump. The fly said loudly, "Hey, little mosquito, we have a great family of flies. We all have two names. When we were young, we called tadpoles. When we grew up, we called flies." What ’s so great about you, do n’t you have two names? Tell you, our mosquito family also has two names. It ’s called a cricket when we were young, and it ’s called a mosquito when we grow up. Awesome! We both have two names. The "radar" spray aimed at them and "bounced", and the mosquito flies were all dead. "The mosquito smiled and said sharply," I thought you had something Amazing, isn't there just two names?
