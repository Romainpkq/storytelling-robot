I don't know who threw the broken glass on the road because of the colorful blood, and dozens of earthworms were stabbed while crossing the road. They were also comatose because of excessive bleeding. The situation was very serious. The animals sent the earthworms to the hospital for rescue. Rescue requires a lot of blood, but the blood bank inventory is not enough, so the animals have to be called to donate blood. A long squid swam to the beach to donate blood at a speed, and it could be seen that there was green blood flowing out of the thief, and the result was useless. "Look at me." The transparent prawns somehow got out of the water and bravely extended their arms. As a result, its blood was pale cyan, and it could not be used. Sea crabs and hairy crabs all came to donate blood, and the result was pale cyan blood. A snail also came, and its blood, like milk, could not be used. The snail's cousin is a snail, and its blood is light blue. The blood of small animals is really colorful!
