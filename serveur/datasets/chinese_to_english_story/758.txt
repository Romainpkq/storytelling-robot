In a windy and sunny day, the two children chased a broken kite flying farther and farther in the clear sky ... "If only you two little angels with wings!" Let's go to the flying eagle! You must be able to catch the kite! "... A few passers-by, seeing this scene, laughed at the two breathless children with laughter. "Yes, why can't people grow a pair of wings to fly in the air like birds?" A fantasy of "flying" towards the sky germinated in these two young hearts. Since then, they have begun to observe the changes in the wings of birds as they fly and glide, and they have carefully crafted various toys that can "fly". When they grew up, they continued to study the principle of flying. Scientific illusions have finally become reality through the hard work of people. In 1903, the world's first aircraft was born. Twenty years ago, the inventor of this propeller plane was struggling to chase the two American children-the Wright brothers-who were flying in the air with a broken kite. You must be able to catch the kite!
