Changing hands Silk flower master Every morning, when the music of sunshine sports sounds, students in each class will rush to the school playground in a hurry. When you pass the small playground, you will always see a blooming "flower" dancing in the breeze. Who is this "flower"? She is Xu Zhuomin from our class. Xu Zhuomin changed her silk flowers very well. I call her "the master of silk flowers". She will not only turn left hand, but also turn up, even if she even made two tops, she will not make mistakes. She is indeed the "hand-changing silk flower master" in my mind. She is Xu Zhuomin from our class.
