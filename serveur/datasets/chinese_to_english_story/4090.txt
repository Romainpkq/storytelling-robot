Look at the lotus flowers, some of the pool lotus leaves are like an umbrella that is stretched out, some are like big green discs, and some are like a small fan. Through the gap between the lotus leaves, I saw a lot of thorns with thorns on the surface of the water. The tops of the lotus stems are covered with white lotus flowers. The lotus is in a variety of poses, one by one, and some are in full bloom, exposing golden stamens and bright yellow small lotus; some only spread two or three petals. Lovely fairy; some still have flowers and buds that haven't been laid. There was a lotus that had just opened and seemed to be shy, hiding behind the big lotus leaf.
