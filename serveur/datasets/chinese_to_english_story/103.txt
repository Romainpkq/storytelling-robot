I go home and take off my shoes. My sister went home and took off her shoes. Brother and father went home and took off their shoes. Shoes of all sizes are nestled together by a family, talking about what they have learned all day. Big and small shoes are like big and small boats. Return to the quiet harbor and enjoy the warmth of your home. Brother and father went home and took off their shoes.
