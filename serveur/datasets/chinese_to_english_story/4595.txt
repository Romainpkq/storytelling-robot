The space dining table is very special. It is magnetic and can attract the knives, forks, and dishes on the table. When eating, astronauts must fix their feet on the floor and their bodies on the seats to avoid fluttering. Don't be anxious to eat, serve the bowl gently, and move too fast, the rice will float away from the bowl. The vegetable is decisive. It should be clamped and clamped accurately. Fork is the best. After the food is clamped, the mouth should be opened faster, and the mouth closed faster, otherwise, the food will fly out of the mouth.
