Winter is here and the little frog is swimming in the small pond. It â€™s so good to find a companion! The little frog asked the loach: "Let's play together?" Said the loach: "It's getting cold. I'm going to dig into the bed to spend the winter!" After I finished, I got into the soft river and disappeared. The little frog asked a little carp next to him: "Let's play together!" The little carp shook his head and said, "We all sleep together in winter!" How should the little frog spend the winter?
