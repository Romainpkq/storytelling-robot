A small drop of water sneaked up to the top of the waterfall to play. Unexpectedly, I climbed to the top of the waterfall, and was pulled to the sky by the sun. After converging with thousands of drops of water into a cloud, it turned into a magic in the sky. The rabbit, after a while, became a running white horse. Under the sun 's rays, the small water droplets draped the clouds with gold rims, and they were extremely happy.
