Impatiens in June, impatiens gradually blossomed, some like butterflies, some like pompon. There are pink, crimson, purple, white. The girls picked their petal juice and dyed their red nails, but they did not fade for a long time. According to my grandmother, Bai Fengxian can be treated with traditional Chinese medicine. Grandpa said that planting impatiens in front of the house behind the door can also drive away the poisonous snakes. The flowering period of Impatiens is very long, some wither, some open, and some results, almost at the same time. The fruit is shaped like a jujube, and its color changes from green to yellow, indicating that it is ripe. If people's hands touch it, it will explode immediately, the outer shell rolls up, and the black seed bullet in the middle is far away. Mom said that this is a special function of impatiens to spread seeds. Fengxian's mother hopes that there will be more children and grandchildren next year.
