Ants and grasshoppers are really hot in summer, and a group of ants are moving food. Some of them have backs, some pull, all sweating. When several grasshoppers saw it, they all laughed that the ant was a fool. They hid under the big tree to cool off, some sang, some went to sleep, and all were free. When winter comes, the northwest wind is blowing, and the ants lie in a hole filled with food for the winter. Grasshoppers are cold and hungry, and they can no longer breathe.
