Promise to the stars Stars open their small eyes and hang on the black velvet, and you look down from above to see if I am innocent? The stars have small eyes open, and they are shining in the peaceful sky. Are you high up, saying, How kind? The stars have small eyes open and their eyelashes blink more than once. Why do you have so many colors, blue, red, and purple? Curious little eyes, staying awake all night, rosy dawn, why should you erase you? The little eyes of the stars shed tears or dew. Are you shaking on top of it, is it because of the cold? The small eyes of the stars, I assure you: If you hold me, I will always, always be innocent. The little eyes of the stars shed tears or dew.
