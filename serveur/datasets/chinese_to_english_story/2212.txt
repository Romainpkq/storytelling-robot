By the clear spring water of the deer and the lion, a deer was bowing its head to drink water. The surface of the water is like a mirror, clearly reflecting the figure of the deer. Deer first looked at a pair of beautiful long horns above his head. This is where he is most proud of. Look at the two thin legs reflected on the water, supporting the body weakly. The deer is a little frustrated. Lu Zhengsi thought, and suddenly found a lion behind him was chasing him. A sense of self-protection drove him to run when he pulled his legs. His thin legs ran lightly and flexibly, leaving the lion far behind. The lion tried desperately to catch up, but his two thick legs were powerless. He could only watch the deer escape with his eyes open. Due to the panic, the deer continued to run and ran into the jungle. Unexpectedly, the branches of the jungle stumbled the two high horns of the deer. Deer struggled desperately, but still couldn't get rid of it, but instead made a loud noise. The lion chased from behind. The lion pounced on the deer and caught the deer. The deer said before he was dying: "I thought that the unsightly saved me, but the one I trusted so much killed me."
