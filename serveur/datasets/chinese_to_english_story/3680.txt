Happy Teacher 's Day Today is September 10th Teacher' s Day. I came to the school early in the morning and saw a variety of real and fake flowers being sold at the entrance of the school. It was so beautiful! I bought flowers and ran into the classroom quickly, and set up the blackboard with my classmates. When the other students are almost here, we estimate that the teacher is coming soon. As expected. In a flash, the teacher came. As soon as the teacher stepped into the classroom, she was startled, and then a beautiful smile appeared on her face. At this moment, the class leader said, "Stand up!" Our classmates stood up and said in unison: "Wish the teacher a happy holiday!" The teacher said excitedly: "Thank you!" As soon as the teacher turned around, he saw colorful flowers on the blackboard Balloons and colorful text, as well as greeting cards made by students. The teacher was very happy and said excitedly: "Thank you! Thank you students!" Ah! This is really a happy holiday.
