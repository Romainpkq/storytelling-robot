Cats and mice A long time ago, cats and mice were close friends. They played together and farmed together. In the first year, they planted radishes. The mouse said to the cat, "Take the stalk, leave it to me!" Soon the radish grew, and the mouse gave the stalk to the cat. Watching as the mouse chewed the brittle radish, the cat slobbered droolingly. The next year, they planted lettuce. "This time you take the stalk and give me the root!" The cat insisted. "Okay, it's up to you!" The mouse agreed quickly. The green lettuce grew taller, and the mouse gave the cat a root. The cat was so angry that the rat biting the tender lettuce. In the third year, they plant daylily. The cat said, "I want both roots and stems, would you like to plant with me?" "Okay!" The mouse said with a smile. The garden was full of flowers and the mouse gave the cat its stems and roots. Watching the mouse proudly taste the golden flowers, the cat fluttered at the mouse with anger ... After that, the cat and the mouse became rivals. Whenever a cat sees a mouse, it will chase after it. What about mice, they only run away blearyly! The green lettuce grew taller, and the mouse gave the cat a root.
