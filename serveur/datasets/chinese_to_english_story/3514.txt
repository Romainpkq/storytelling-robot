It's snowing, it's snowing, it's snowing! Snow flakes fell from the sky. The snow is getting bigger and bigger, like goose feathers, like cotton wool, like white butterflies, and it looks very good. The snow stopped, the ground was white, the house was white, and the whole ground was white. The children made snowmen in the snow and played snowball fights. They are having a good time!
