A few days ago, my mother gave me and my sister a big pomegranate. Pomegranate is not good-looking. It does not have the rosy and smooth appearance of apples, which makes people look envious; it also does not have the seductive aroma of pineapples, which makes people smell covetous. It has only a layer of rough yellow skin, rustic in nature, and a crack on it, like a grinning grin. I can't figure out why there is a crack here. Mom told me that it is where the pomegranate blooms. I opened the yellow layer of pomegranate: Ah! Inside are all very beautiful seeds like crystal beads. They're crowded tightly and they're full. They look really good. The seeds are eaten in the mouth, sweet and sour, really smelling! My sister and I like to eat very much. My mother said to us: "Do n’t you just see its seeds look good and delicious, you ca n’t see the rustic peel in the soil, hi, it is also a traditional Chinese medicine for diarrhea!" Eating pomegranate, listening to my mother, I Understood: Everything must not only look at its appearance. Although pomegranates are not beautiful in appearance, they are useful from the inside out.
