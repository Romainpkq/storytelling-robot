Blowing bubbles I gently blew away a series of soap bubbles, they were carrying red orange yellow green green blue blue purple and flew away. I am very sad, looking for them while walking. A crystal dewdrop stood on the blade of grass and said to me: "Do you think I look like the bubble you blow? Let's be friends!" A round balloon also floated from a distance and said to me: "You See if I am the bubble you lost? Let me make a friend with you! "... I happily ran home and told my mother that I had many, many friends.
