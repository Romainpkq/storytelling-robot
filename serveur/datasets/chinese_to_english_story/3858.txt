Black Swan Black Swan heard everyone said that during the day the goose is beautiful, thinking: I was not born black, it was born white! Hi ! If only one day can change the feather with the white swan. Finally the black swan came up with a solution. At night, it went to find a bottle of ink and a box of white powder. While taking advantage of the white swan's deep sleep, it quietly smeared ink on it, and wiped itself with white powder. Early the next morning, as soon as the sisters opened their eyes, the black swan hurriedly announced: "Look, the white swan has turned black, I have turned white, the white swan is ugly, I am beautiful!" , Laughing at the black swans one after another. The black swan was puzzled for a while. At this time, the elder sister came over and said with a long heart: "Little girl, we usually say you are ugly and say that the white swan is beautiful, not referring to your appearance, but to your heart. Usually the white swan thinks much about everyone, this is its advantage. You think of yourself all day long. Take the thing you did today, do nâ€™t you prove your ugliness? In fact, what is the use of smearing and disguising yourself? If you want to throw away the ugliness, if you want to say that you are beautiful, you must thoroughly correct your shortcomings. "
