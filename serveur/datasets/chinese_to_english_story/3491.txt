Treasures forever when I was young, I didn't even know that there was Mother's Day. I remember when I was in the kindergarten class, the teacher told us that Mother's Day is a holiday for children to express their gratitude to their mothers, and thank them for giving birth, raising me, and raising me. At that time, the teacher taught us to use red paper to cut a "heart" and write your name on it and give it to mom. That day, my mother happened to be back from abroad. My father and I went to the airport to meet her. When I saw my mother, I was embarrassed to take the gift out; my father reminded me next to me that I gave my mother the heart. I said to my mother: "Mother, Happy Mother's Day!" My mother hugged me and kissed me twice. There seemed to be a tear in my eyes. Mother put the "heart" in her box and kept it until now. No matter where her mother is, this "heart" always accompanies her. I deeply feel: my little intention brings happiness to my mother and makes her treasure forever.
