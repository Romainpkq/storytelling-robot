In the summer quietly, quietly, like a lively green kid who loves climbing poles, he stretches his calves and crawls everywhere. Climb, climb, add green leaves to the tree. Climb, climb, put the green grapes on the grape shelf. Climb, climb, give the wall, round the green vine. Climb, climb, put on a small hillside, put on a green dress ... People love to praise him this way: This green kid is really hardworking! They didn't see him, they couldn't touch him, but we did know that he was here! —— What a cool green color he brought us! The student who often reads books in a window covered with greenery gives him a name and says his name, it is called "Summer".
