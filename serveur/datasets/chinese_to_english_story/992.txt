June 1 is Children's Day. On this day, colorful flags fluttered on the campus, and the children 's faces came to the school cheerfully. The celebration began. Many factories and neighborhood committees gave us gifts, including toys, chess pieces, books, and small footballs. The students sang, danced, performed martial arts, and performed tricks, and performed wonderful programs. At the celebration, all of our first grade children wore red scarves. The teacher told us that the young pioneers should win glory for the red scarf and be the little master of the motherland. I must remember what the teacher said.
