The little sand chicken sent the water to the hot desert. The mother of the sand chicken was sick. She lay under a cactus and gasped and said, "Water, water ..." The little sand chicken quickly helped her mother to find water. It looked in the endless desert, and finally found a small puddle. The little sand chicken was so happy that he didn't want to drink it himself, and quickly dipped his hairy body into the puddle. The feathers of sand grouses have a strong ability to absorb water, and they will be full of water soon. It flew under the cactus and said, "Mom, I've brought you water!" The mother of the sand chicken stretched her mouth into the feathers of the little sand chicken and sucked the water into her mouth. Mother Sand Chicken smiled and said, "You are such a sensible child!" Little Sand Chicken said, "Mom, when I was a kid, you gave me water like this!"
