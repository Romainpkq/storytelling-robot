My good friend Recently, my father brought me a good friend. He is not tall, with a square head and a big face. Sitting there quietly, speaking very little. His ability is great! Every day, as soon as I came home, he became my best friend and teacher. We read books, draw pictures, and play games together ... My friend is amazing, he wouldn't be without him. It was right and quick to start the question, and the things I told him would never be forgotten. He can also keep me from going out, knowing everything I want to know. How is it, my good friend is good! Child, do you know who he is?
