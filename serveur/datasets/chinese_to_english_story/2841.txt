The hens plant rice for one day, and the hens find some rice. She asked the duckling: "Will you grow rice with me?" The duckling said, "It's too hard to grow rice, I'm afraid to bend down!" The little hen had to grow rice by himself. As the seedlings grew taller, the little hen asked the kitten: "Will you hoe with me?" The kitten said, "Weed is too hard. I'm afraid of blistering my hands!" The little hen had to weed the grass by herself. When the rice was cooked, the little hen asked the little pig: "Will you collect rice with me?" The little pig said, "It's too hard to collect the rice. I'm afraid it will get muddy!" The little hen had to collect the rice by himself. The little hen beat the rice into rice and made it into fragrant and sweet white rice. It was given to the duckling, who lowered his head. For the little cat, the little cat blushed. To the piglet, the piglet said, "We will grow rice with you next year!"
