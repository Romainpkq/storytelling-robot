Shooting fish Shooting fish live in the water but can catch flying insects in the air. When they swim on the water surface, they can not only see things on the water surface, but also objects in the air. Once they see the captured objects, they secretly swim over, aim first, and then spray a bunch from their mouths. A thin water column hits flying insects into the water. The water jet from the mouth of a shooter fish can reach more than 3 meters high. It can not only knock down small insects such as flies, bees, and butterflies, but also hurt people's eyes. This ability of shooting fish is really like a submarine launching missiles at the bottom of the water to hit an airplane in the air. The water jet from the mouth of a shooter fish can reach more than 3 meters high. It can not only knock down small insects such as flies, bees, and butterflies, but also hurt people's eyes.
