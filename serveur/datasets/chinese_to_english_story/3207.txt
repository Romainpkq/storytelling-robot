When I was a kid blowing bubbles, I played many games. Among them, the one I love playing most is blowing soap bubbles. In the rainy season, we can't go to the beach on the mountain to play, our mother taught us to blow soap bubbles on the porch. She said that in rainy and rainy days, the weather is humid and the soap bubbles are not easy to break. We put the leftover soap head in a small wooden bowl, add a little water, and mix it and make it melt. Then use a thin bamboo tube, dipped in the thick soapy water, and slowly blow up, blowing into a light and round bubble. Gently mentioned again, the light round ball fell from the bamboo tube and floated slowly in the air. If you fan gently underneath, they can sometimes fly very high. This soap bubble is very beautiful, with five colors of floating light, twirling on the clear and transparent sphere. If the fan is well fanned, a big ball will split into two or three small balls, and they will be scattered. Sometimes the blow is too big, and the fan is too anxious. The fragile ball will be long and round, trembling, and the light and shadow will be chaotic. At this moment, everyone hung their heads, held their heads up, and held their breathâ€”soon, the multi-colored thin ball broke apart silently, and turned into soapy water, and the water droplets spilled into our eyes. Everyone hurriedly lowered their heads, rubbed their eyes, and rubbed tears. The balls were blown out carefully and carefully by ourselves. They flew gently, so round, so free, so transparent, so beautiful. By the breeze of the fans, they flew into the sky one by one, gently next to the moon, crossed the Tianhe, and followed the sunset west. Or floating gently across the sea, flying over the top of the mountain ... Watching them, our hearts are full of happiness, pride and hope.
