The scenery of the West Lake is very beautiful all year round. In spring, weeping willow combed her hair by the lake, and the pink peach blossoms were full of branches. In summer, the duckweed is green and the lotus is reflecting the sun. In autumn, sweet-scented osmanthus fragrant, chrysanthemum scrambles. In winter, Lamei opens up against the wind and snow.
