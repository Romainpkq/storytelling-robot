I like the sun flower. It is the most common flower in summer. The stems of sunflowers are red and green. The stem is very tender, and it seems that water will come out when you pinch it with your hand. The leaves of the sun flower are very special, small and thick, and the surface of the leaf is coated with a thin layer of wax, smooth and green. The colors of sunflowers are exceptionally bright, some are as white as jade, some are as bright as fire, and some are as golden as gold, and the pink ones are like a light blush, the flowers are not large, and the natural beauty of the multi-layered petals The single-layered petals are so pretty and really flattering. I like the sun flower, not only because of its bright colors, but also because it has tenacious vitality, it is not afraid of the sun, the wind, and the rain. It â€™s always vigorous like that. Just plug in a small stem and plug in In the soil, it will soon take root and bloom.
