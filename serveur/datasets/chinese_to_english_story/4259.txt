George and his little axe George got a little axe, and it was tickling in his heart. He wanted to try the axe sharp or not. He ran into the garden and saw a tree. Without thinking, he raised a small axe and cut down the tree. After a while, Dad came back. "Who cut my beloved cherry tree?" Dad exclaimed angrily, "If I knew who did it, I would ..." George lowered his head and said: "Dad, I want to try my little ax "" Dad's anger disappeared immediately. He hugged George and said, "You told me the truth, I'm very happy. I'd rather lose twelve cherry trees than you would tell a lie."
