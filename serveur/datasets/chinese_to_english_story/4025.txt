The little fox's necklace The little fox and his father and mother planted many broad beans last fall. In spring, broad beans bloom beautiful butterfly flowers, and bear many big and full broad beans. They harvested many broad beans. The mother of the fox stringed the broad beans to make a green necklace, which hung around the little fox's neck. The little fox was wearing a green necklace and looked in the mirror. It was so beautiful! She went out happily to find a little friend to play with. On the way, the little fox came across a little flower dog. The little flower dog was lying on the ground looking for something! The little fox asked strangely, "Little flower dog, what are you looking for?" The little flower dog said sadly, "My button was lost." The little fox looked, and the little flower dog's pants really lacked a green button. The little fox immediately took a broad bean and handed it to the little flower dog: "Is this button beautiful?" The little flower dog said happily: "Thank you, little fox!" The little fox went on, and suddenly heard the little flower cat "Meow" was very fierce, she hurried over to watch. It turned out that tomorrow is the birthday of a good friend, Little Rabbit, and the little cat is preparing a picture for the little rabbit. There are green leaves and red flowers on the painting, but some fruits are missing. The little cat does not know how to paint the fruits. The little fox understood it, immediately took off the necklace, and handed it to the little cat, saying, "Just hang these fruits on it!" Everyone hung the broad beans on the leaves and flowers with all their hands, haha! This picture is so beautiful! Everyone happily danced around the painting. It was dark and the little fox bounced back home. What happened to the little fox's mother? Where is the little fox 's necklace?
