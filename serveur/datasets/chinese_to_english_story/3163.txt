There are three little goldfish that are very beautiful. They think it is very boring to swim in the water every day. So, they decided to learn a little. A small goldfish with blistering eyes decided to build a house with hermit crab. At first, it was careless. Later, it was bitten by a hermit crab and learned a lesson before it began to build a house seriously. The second red-tailed fish saw "scavenger" (a nickname for a fish) cleaning the environment, and felt that it was glorious to create a beautiful environment for everyone, so he decided to learn this line. At first it was learned very seriously, but it didn't take long to get bored. It said, "I can't stand the backache every day after cleaning the environment." In the end, I could only give up halfway. Article 3: The naughty little goldfish learns to swim with the swordfish. When the swordfish just talked about the essentials of learning to swim, it swam away impatiently, thinking to myself: I have learned these things long before, and there is nothing to learn. A month later, the blister-eyed little goldfish learned something, while the other two little goldfish could only swim around without success.
