Little Monkey Learning Skills On Sunday, the little monkey did not know what to do, so he went to the Little White Rabbit underground railway. When he saw the little white rabbit writing at home, he found it very interesting and decided to learn this line. It said to the little white rabbit: "Little white rabbit, will you teach me how to write essays?" Little white rabbit said: "Okay, you go home and practice by yourself!" The little monkey returned home and took out a pen Write an article on paper. I wrote, I heard someone outside playing the trumpet. At first glance, it turned out to be Brother Xiong. The monkey again found it interesting to play the trumpet, so he decided to learn this line. It blows and blows, and it always doesn't blow, so it doesn't want to learn again. At this moment, it saw Sister Xiaolu practicing running again, running fast! It decided to learn to run again. However, I ran a few times and felt too tired to learn again. Later, Little White Rabbit became a writer, Little Bear became a musician, Little Deer became an excellent long-distance runner, how happy are the three little friends!
