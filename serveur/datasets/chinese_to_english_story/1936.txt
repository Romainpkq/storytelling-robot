The fox pretended to smile, and said to the crow, "Miss Crow, you are getting more and more beautiful. The walking posture is more beautiful than a peacock!" The crow loves to be told that it is beautiful, so it flies down and walks up and down before the fox. The fox pretended to be concerned and said, "Miss Crow, why do you have so few clothes to spend the winter?" The crow said, "I just warm my head under the wings!" The fox said, "You are so smart! But what about the head? How about digging under the wings? "The crow was so happy after hearing so much good words. It said, "I'll drill it for you." Then he drilled his head under the wings. The crow 's head had just penetrated into its wings, and the fox said "What a good thing! What a good thing!" He rushed up and ate the crow. The crow who loves to listen to good things one day, the fox doesn't eat for a day, and his stomach is very hungry.
