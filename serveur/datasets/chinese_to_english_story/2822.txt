The spring clothes of the little rabbits are here, and the creatures on the earth have a new look. Mother Rabbit said to the little rabbit: "We should change our clothes!" The little rabbit looked at the white leather jacket and said, "No, the white jacket is beautiful!" After that, he went to play in the woods. When the little rabbit saw the partridge bird wearing a flower dress, he asked strangely, "How did you change the white dress to a flower dress?" The partridge bird said, "It is not easy to be spotted by the enemy when you put on the flower dress in spring. Encountered a frog. The frog just woke up after hibernation, and after bathing, his whole body was shiny green. He said to the little rabbit: "My new clothes are the same color as the grass, so it is convenient to catch bugs!" At this time, a grasshopper popped up and wore green clothes. The grasshopper said, "I like to jump around in the grass. My mother said, it is appropriate to wear this kind of clothes. You should also go to change your spring clothes!" Little Rabbit quickly went home to change clothes. My mother said with a smile: "Your clothes have been changed!" The little rabbit looked, and he had grown a lot of gray hairs on his body, and changed into gray spring clothes!
