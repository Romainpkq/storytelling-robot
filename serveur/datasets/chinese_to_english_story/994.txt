During the summer vacation, my father took me to travel by plane. On the plane, through the window, I saw the blue sky and the white clouds. The plane flew higher and higher, flying higher than the white clouds. After getting off the plane, we took a tourist bus and came to the foot of the mountain to find that the early people had started to climb the mountain. My dad and I hurried to climb the mountain. We climbed to the middle of the mountain and saw a group of monkeys. The little monkey saw us, ran over, reached out his hand, and asked us for something to eat. We looked down on the top of the mountain and saw that the people on the path down the mountain were very small and very small, and they became a dwarf country. What a fun! I like to travel .
