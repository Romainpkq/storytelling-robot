The dog doctor asked the monkey lab technician to give the animal a blood test. There are so many patients! Spiders, snails, shrimps, earthworms ... all are here. The monkey lab technicians took their blood and put them in glass tubes. The test results came out, but Dr. Flower Dog found that there was no name on the glass tube. It turned out that the monkey lab technician forgot to write the name. The little monkey was crying anxiously. The flower dog said, "Don't worry, the turquoise is the blood of the spider, the light blue is the blood of the snail, the cyan is the blood of the shrimp, and the rose red is the blood of the earthworm." The monkey listened and wrote carefully on the glass tube. The name, and said, "In the future, I must be serious." The test results came out, but Dr. Flower Dog found that there was no name on the glass tube.
