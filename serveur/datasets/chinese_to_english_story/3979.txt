Sister Moon's new partner, Sister Moon, followed Mother Earth, spinning around day and night. Once, they turned to the Milky Way and suddenly found a new partner beside them. Sister Moon asked: "Who are you? Why fly to heaven?" "I am an artificial satellite, Mother Earth sent me to heaven. I can help human beings to broadcast TV news, I will scout planes, warships, I will report typhoon news, I will look for oil and coal ... "After the satellites finished speaking, Sister Moon smiled and said," Welcome! Now I am not only accompanied by a space shuttle, a spaceship, but also a new partner sent by Mother Earth. "
