The country is the world of trees. On both sides of the road are tall sycamores. The sycamore branches are connected to the branches, and the leaves are covered with leaves, like a green corridor. On both sides of the small river are weeping willows in rows. The wicker is thin, the willow is green. On the hillside, the pine and cypress trees are tall and upright, with lush foliage. Fruit trees are planted around the farmyards: plums, peach trees, plum trees, apricot trees ... Late spring and early summer, all kinds of fruit trees spread their leaves and grow lush, the farmhouses are hidden in the dense greenery in.
