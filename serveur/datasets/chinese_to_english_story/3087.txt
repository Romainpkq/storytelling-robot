The moon sprouted, the moon sprouted, in the little black room where the stars were jumping. The moon has sprouted secretly. Can one fingernail cover grow overnight? Can you grow a little nail cover in a day? It grows long, grows long, will it be embarrassed to be seen? I know it needs to grow into a little girl, to be golden, to be bright, to have a little loneliness and pride. Grow into a moon flower!
