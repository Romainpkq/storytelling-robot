The spring rain was sprinkled on the ground, and the depression was already a clear piece of light. The clear rain light reflected the dark clouds in the sky, and also the people's busy figure. A gust of wind blew through, and small layers of ripples appeared on the surface of the water, rippling in circles, forming beautiful blossoms. After a while, a breeze blew, and the rain curtain slanted, like a big spider spitting out filaments of thread and running towards the wall. The rain fell on the grass, voila! The grass shook gently against the wind, and the rain rolled down its green blades. I saw a drop of water go into the grass's mouth, and I couldn't find it. what ! In the long spring rain, you are really a good friend of Mother Earth. Flowers, trees and trees all need you.
