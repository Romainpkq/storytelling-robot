Words on the beach Little crabs practice writing on the beach by the sea. He wrote and wrote, the words became crooked. Uncle Wave rushed over and hurriedly erased his words. The little crab writes again. It was written, and the words became crooked again. Uncle Ocean came again to help him erase the words. The little crab was not discouraged. He was suffocated and started writing again. This time he wrote a little bit slower, but he took care to write it. The lines were lined up one after the other, and the writing was neat and straight. The mother of seagulls flying by the sea said to her little seagulls, "Look, how beautiful the words of the little crab are!" "Mom, what is he writing?" The little seagulls asked. "What he wrote was: Good boys are not afraid of hardships," said Mother Seagull. This time, Uncle Wave never washed the word away, but left the word on the beach all the time. Uncle Wave rushed over and hurriedly erased his words.
