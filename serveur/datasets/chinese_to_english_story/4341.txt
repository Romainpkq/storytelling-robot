Tree doctors People say that woodpeckers are hardworking tree doctors. The woodpecker's mouth is pointed and hard, like a chisel. The tongue is thin and long, and there are hooks on the tongue. When the woodpecker found that there were pests under the bark, he pecked the bark first, then stretched out the tongue with hooks, and then stringed the pests on the tongue one by one, and finally used saliva to bring out the bugs and eggs.
