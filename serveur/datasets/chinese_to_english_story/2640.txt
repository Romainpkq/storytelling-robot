The spring of pomegranate is here, and the pomegranate is blooming. Its flowers are orange-red, its stamens are pale yellow, and there are some thin petals on its head. At the end of summer, some pomegranate flowers have bigger and bigger belly, and soon they will be as big as eggs. A few weeks later, the petals of the pomegranate flower gradually fell. The pomegranates all cracked their mouths and smiled. How neat the rows of red "teeth" were. Autumn is here, the pomegranate is ripe, pick it down and try it, hey! It's sour and sweet, so delicious. In winter, when the northwest wind blows, the leaves on the tree fall down.
