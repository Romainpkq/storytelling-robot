Mother Swallow hatched four little swallows. They have long black hairs, white belly, and small yellow mouths with sharp points, stretch out their long small necks, and shake their little round heads. You hold me, I squeeze you. When Daddy Yan and Mama Yan came back from the insects, they squeezed out, squeezing their heads out, opening their mouths, extending their necks, eager to eat. If you ca nâ€™t eat it, you scream.
