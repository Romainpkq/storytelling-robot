What kind of earth is it? I took the spaceship to the sky to see what the earth looks like. The earth turned out to be a big ball, dressed in floral clothes. The green places are: forests, crops and grasslands. The blue places are: rivers, lakes and oceans. The yellow place is: the desert with yellow sand flying. It was like the rolling waves: high and low mountains. The white places are: the snow-bound Antarctic and Arctic. Ah, I returned to the earth in a spaceship, and now I know what the earth is like.
