Children love their hometown, and they love to paint their beautiful hometown. Taotao's hometown is by the sea. The sea he painted was so blue and so wide. One boat is full of fish and shrimps. The child who picked up shells on the beach with bare feet is Tao Tao. Shanshan's hometown is in the mountains. The mountains he painted are so high, and the water is so clear. Before and after the house are tall and big trees. The mountains and hills in the painting, carrying a small bamboo basket, are about to go to the woods to gather mushrooms.
