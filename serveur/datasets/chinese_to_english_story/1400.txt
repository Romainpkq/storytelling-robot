Uncle Hippo is selling balloons. The colorful balloons are tied to the shelves with rope, so dazzling! The little mouse wants to buy a balloon, but he has no money. What should I do? Coincidentally, Uncle Hippo yawned, closed his eyes, and closed his eyes. The little mouse ran quietly over, snapped a rope tied to the balloon, grabbed the balloon's tail, turned and ran. Who knew that the balloon was so buoyant that it carried him into the air. As it floated higher and higher, the little mouse panicked, and wanted to release his hand, and he was afraid of being hurt, so he had to drag the balloon to float. Where did it finally go? No one knows. Uncle Hippo is selling balloons.
