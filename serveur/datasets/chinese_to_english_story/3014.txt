I went home and took off my shoes. My sister came home and took off her shoes. My brother and dad both took off their shoes when they came home. Big and small shoes are a family snuggling together, talking about a day's experience. Big and small shoes, like big and small boats, go back to the quiet harbor and enjoy the warmth of the home.
