My old cat cares about his children very much. Every time it comes back from outside, it will lie down and feed the kittens. When the little cat eats milk, it always licks their hair for them, as if they are bathing them. Which kitten is a little uncomfortable, the old cat will keep turning around the kitten, screaming "Miao Wu Miao Wu" in his mouth, as if asking, "Baby, where are you? Tell mom quickly! "
