Brothers and Sisters of Little Turtles Open Stores Brothers and Sisters of Little Turtles want to open a small store. What kind of store should I open? They asked the elephant. The elephant said, "I have a flower shop, I can spray flowers with a big nose." They asked the hippopotamus, and they said, "I open a balloon shop, and I can blow out the biggest balloon with a big mouth!" How about it? Mother Kangaroo tells them: "I opened a newspaper shop and put the newspapers in big pockets. I can sell them everywhere." Brothers and sisters of the little turtles are sad: "We don't have long noses, big mouths, and big pockets. What should I do? "Later, the little turtle brothers and sisters were no longer sad, and they opened a pancake shop. Let the sun bake its own back shell and spread pancakes on the back shell. Bake it, bake it, and it smells delicious. The little turtle's sesame cake was fragrant and crispy, and there was a beautiful pattern on it. Everyone came to buy it. "They asked the hippopotamus, and the hippopotamus said," I open a balloon shop and I can blow out the biggest balloon with my big mouth!
