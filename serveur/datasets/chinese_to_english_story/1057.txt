In some archipelagoes of Brazil and the Pacific, a "bread" tree grows. The bread tree is more than ten meters high, with thick trunks, lush foliage, and thick shades like a natural pergola. From July to November each year, round fruits will be produced on the tree. This fruit is as big as volleyball and as small as tennis. The fruit is green when tender and turns yellow when mature. A tree often has hundreds or thousands of fruits like toasted yellow bread. From July to November each year, round fruits will be produced on the tree.
