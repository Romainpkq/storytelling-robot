There is a radio and television tower beside the Huangpu River in Shanghai. She has a beautiful name called "Oriental Pearl". This tower, with the blue sky above it, stepped on the earth with its feet, like a giant. At night, the lights on the tower are all lit, colorful, and very beautiful. The Shanghai Radio and TV Tower is really a beautiful oriental pearl.
