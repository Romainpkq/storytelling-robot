Little paper boat Little brown bear folds a small paper boat into the stream every day, and let the water float the small paper boat to the doorstep of his good friend Red Squirrel. But one day they quarreled and the little brown bear never gave a little paper boat to the red squirrel again. After a few days, the little brown bear was very sad. He still folded the small paper boat every day, but he didn't put the paper boat into the stream. The red squirrel wrote a few words of apology on the paper boat that the little brown bear had given him before and made him drift to the door of the little brown bear's house. They soon made up again.
