Watching the lanterns is the Lantern Festival today. After dinner, I followed my mother to the street to watch the lights. Along the way, all kinds of small lanterns are dizzying. Look, the colorful lights are as colorful as the little stars blinking and blinking. The white jade lights are even more striking. They rise into the sky like the moon in the sky and brighten the road. The colorful neon lights are bright and colorful, and the pedestrian street is beautifully decorated. What impressed me most was the lamps under several big trees. At the beginning, I was still thinking, it is still early spring. Why are the leaves on these big trees so green? Take a closer look and see that the light under the tree is green. The lights, green and green, were reflected on the big trees, and the leaves of the trees immediately became green, like a layer of jade. What impressed me most was the lamps under several big trees.
