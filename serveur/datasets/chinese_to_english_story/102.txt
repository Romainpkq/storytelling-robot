Spring rain The rustling spring rain, like thousands of silk threads, floats down ... The swallows passing by the rain, weaving a beautiful picture of spring. The green ones are willow leaves, and the red ones are peach flowers. A clear river was also woven, and the fish in the river shook their tails cheerfully. Under the hillside across the river, there are sowing farmers; there are dolls planting trees ... Ah! What a beautiful picture! The swallows shuttled under the rain, weaving a beautiful picture of spring.
