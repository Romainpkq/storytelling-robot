Roosters, rabbits, and ducks are neighbors. In the morning, the rabbit borrowed a pot from the rooster. The cock said, "Don't borrow it." In the afternoon, the duck asked the cock to help pick water. The cock said, "Don't go." In the evening, there was a sudden strong wind and heavy rain. The roof of the rooster was blown off by the strong wind, and he was so anxious that he barked and jumped. When the rabbit and duck heard the rooster's cry, they put down their work and ran to help the rooster repair the roof. The wind stopped, the rain stopped, and the roof was repaired. The cock looks at the repaired roof, and then the rabbit and duck, and the cock blushes. Roosters, rabbits, and ducks are neighbors.
