My favorite is rose flowers. The rose flower has a thin and very long stem with many small hard thorns on it. If you touch it, it will pierce you fiercely. The leaves of rose flowers are oval with many small teeth on the side. The most beautiful are the rose flowers in many colors, red, white, and yellow. Flowers of all colors are very beautiful when they bloom. My favorite is rose flowers.
