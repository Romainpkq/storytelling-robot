The baby especially likes to look at the window, because the window always changes color. When the window becomes blue, mother said, it is the blue sky in the distance. When the window turned golden, my mother said, it was the light of the sun. When the window turned gray, my mother said, it was gray clouds. When the window turned black and covered with small silver stones, my mother said, it was night.
