One day, the cock said to the frog, "My ability is the best, I call the sun." The frog said, "Can you call the sun at night?" The cock said, "Yes!" Call out. After a while, it really lighted up outside. The cock is happy. No matter what, the owner locked up the chicken. It turned out that what the cock saw was the light of an electric lamp. The next day, the sun rose from the east. "Said the frog." Can you call the sun out at night?
