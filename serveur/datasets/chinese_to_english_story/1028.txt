I am a little snail and live in the field. I walk with my house on my back every day. I climb my tree on my back, play on my back, and look for food on my back. My house has no windows, and the sun never shines in. My home doesn't have tables and chairs, so I can only stay with myself. If you come to see me and there is no place for you to sit, I think it is better for me to go to you. I climb my tree on my back, play on my back, and look for food on my back.
