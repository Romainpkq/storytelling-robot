I am a space shuttle. My job is mainly to send all kinds of satellites to space, and bring back the satellites that have problems to the ground for inspection and repair. My body is already large and heavy, and with satellites or something, it becomes even heavier. So I have to take the rocket to send me to a high altitude. After reaching a height of 43 kilometers, I can fly into space orbit by myself and fly around the earth without stopping. I am more advanced than a spaceship. When returning to the ground, I can glide and land like an airplane myself, so I can reuse it, unlike a rocket that is scrapped only once.
