One day, five fingers gathered to discuss who has the greatest skill. The thumb first stood up proudly and said: "This question is very simple, of course, I have the greatest ability, or why should I rank first?" The second thumb stopped, and hurriedly said: "I am the most amazing, no matter what people do , I used my finger to point, where did you do anything? "The middle finger didn't wait for the second thumb to finish, and quickly stood up and said," Look, look, straighten out five fingers, which is the tallest than Bibi. " ... The ring finger and the little finger are not to be outdone. They all take their own housekeeping skills and argue with them. Their quarrel was heard by the flower ball in the corner, and the flower ball gave them a suggestion: see who can take it, and whoever has the most credit. The five fingers looked at each other, and they all felt that the proposal was feasible, so they rubbed their hands and tried each one, but none of them could pick it up. The flower ball made another suggestion: What would happen if you brought your five fingers together? Five fingers were put together, and it was picked up with a light touch. Look at me with five fingers, and I look at you, all smiled embarrassedly.
