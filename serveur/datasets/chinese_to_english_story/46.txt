Spring Spring girl's rustling footsteps are near. The infinite bright spring on the field made Xiao He more enchanting. The grass on the shore secretly got out of the soil and danced lightly under the breeze of spring, and the grass was like a turquoise blanket in the sun. The children were sitting on it, lying down, and some were rolling. The little lamb jumped "motherly" beside her mother. On both sides of the river, rows of weeping willows grow green buds, cuckoos and magpies, bouncing on the branches, singing crisp and gentle songs, and the branches of the weeping willows protrude into the thawing river, as if to wash away the cold winter. The breeze blew through, and waves rippled on the water surface. The green mountains and trees reflected in the water expanded for a while, shrank for a while, gathered for a while, and spread out like naughty fish swimming there. On both sides of the river, rows of weeping willows grow green buds, cuckoos and magpies, bouncing on the branches, singing crisp and gentle songs, and the branches of the weeping willows protrude into the thawing river, as if to wash away the cold winter.
