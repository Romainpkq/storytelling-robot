I saw the woodpecker on Saturday and Sunday. My father and mother took me to the Shanghai Botanical Garden to visit the newly completed "Tropical Botanical Museum". It was noon after visiting the "Orchid Garden" and "Bonsai Garden". We found a towering tree. Under the shade, my father and mother laid plastic sheets. We sat on the floor and prepared for a picnic. Soon, there was a "Tuk Tuk" sound like a knocking wooden fish. I didn't take it seriously at first, but with the sound came a sliver of wood dust, sprinkled on our jam like pepper, and I thought someone was joking with us. I was wondering, the sound of "Tuk Tuk" was getting closer and closer, and then I listened carefully, the sound came from above our heads. When I looked up and looked up, I was overjoyed. A woodpecker was pecking hard at the hole. Soon after, a large bug was hooked. After I saw it, it spread its wings and flew away. This trip to the botanical garden was so happy, I saw a woodpecker.
