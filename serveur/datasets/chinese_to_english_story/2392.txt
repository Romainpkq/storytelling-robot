spring is coming ! The tender green wicker swayed gently against the warm spring breeze. The green lawn seems to lay a soft carpet on the ground. The flowers bloomed, with golden spring flowers, pink peach flowers, snow-white pear flowers, and purple lilac flowers. It is really a season full of purple and red!
