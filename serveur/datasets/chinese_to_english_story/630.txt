Thumb class Our class has a very nice name, called "Thumb Class". You see, there is a bright red "thumb" on the wall above the blackboard. There is a line of English "I'm the best one" next to it, that is "I am the first". Next to the blackboard is a "sunflower" red flower table, turquoise leaves, golden disks, and a small piece of "Hanako". There are photos of our class children. If anyone has a little red flower, he will happily paste it next to the picture. We also often get more safflowers than anyone else. Everyone wants to be first. The children in the "thumbs class" all stand up. Thumb class Our class has a very nice name, called "Thumb Class".
