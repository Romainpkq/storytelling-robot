The little tree came over winter and winter, and the northwest wind was blowing. We put on cotton clothes. Dad said: "We are cold. The little tree is cold. We should help the little tree to survive the winter safely." As Dad brought the straw and rope, I quickly followed Dad to the little tree. We first wrapped the trunk of the small tree with straw, and then carefully tied it one by one with rope. Looking at the little tree in front of me, I said happily: "When the little tree puts on the winter coat, it is not afraid of the wind, rain and snow."
