One day, a white sheep went up the canopy bridge from the south, and a black sheep got up the canoe bridge from the north. They came to the bridge at the same time, and Aries said, "You go back, let me cross the bridge first!" Black sheep said, "You go back, let me cross the bridge first!" They didn't want anyone to let them go. Arise, after a while, I only heard the sound of "Plop! Plop!" In the river, and they all fell into the river.
