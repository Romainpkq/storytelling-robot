Hua Luogeng Guess the famous mathematician Hua Luogeng in a different way. He got a book. Instead of reading it from beginning to end, he thought about it for a while, then closed his eyes and meditated. He guessed the layout of the book. After considering it, he opened the book. If the author's ideas were consistent with his own guess, he would not read it again. Hua Luogeng's guessing method not only saves reading time, but also cultivates his own thinking and imagination, so as not to make himself a slave of the book.
