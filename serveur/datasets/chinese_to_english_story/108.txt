Why do you need to paint lime on the trunk? We often see that the lower half of some trees in the park, in the orchard and on the road are painted white. This white substance is lime water. This white coating has a lot to offer! First of all, this concentration of lime water can not only destroy the pests and diseases, but also kill all kinds of overwintering eggs. Secondly, this white coating prevents frostbite of trees. Because the temperature difference between day and night in the northern region is large, especially in the early spring before winter. The trunk is susceptible to expansion and cracking when frozen. The white coating can reflect part of the sunlight and heat energy, so that the temperature of the trunk does not change much, and the effect of the temperature difference on the trees is reduced. Thirdly, the white coating of the trunks not only has the effect of beautifying the environment, but also prevents the animals from eating on the trees and protects the normal growth of the trees.
