I love my mother My mother has an upside down melon seed face, short and messy hair, and her small eyes are slit into a slit when she laughs.

The next day, I got up early and saw a brand new pair of pants on the table, oh! It turned out to be the torn pants of a neighbor! But it was so beautiful. There was a little bear in that broken place, and it was so embroidered! Mother 's craftsmanship is really good! In addition to being clever, she also likes to help others.
