Antonyms are a pair of big, one small, one ostrich and one ant. More on one side and less on the other, a pile of sand and a grain of rice. One is thick, the other is thin, the post is a pen. A circle, a square, a basketball and a basket. One fat, one thin, one elephant and one deer. One tall, one short, one brother and one me. Take a look, take a look, the antonyms are remembered.
