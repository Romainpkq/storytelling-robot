The sky here on the prairie is especially blue and the air is especially fresh. White flocks take a leisurely walk on the green grass, just like the large white flowers embroidered on the green carpet. The shepherd rode on the galloping horse, waving the sheep's whip, and sang the beautiful idyll: "White clouds float in the blue sky, and the horses run under the white clouds ..." Ah, a vibrant scene on the beautiful prairie! White flocks take a leisurely walk on the green grass, just like the large white flowers embroidered on the green carpet.
