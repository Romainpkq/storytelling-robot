Butterflies Gift Today, my good friend Wang Jing and I went to play after having lunch. I saw a butterfly resting on the flower and walked lightly. I reached out and grabbed it. Unfortunately, the speed was too slow and the butterfly escaped. But Wang Jing caught a butterfly. She said to me, "I'll give it to you." I quickly said, "Thank you." I pinched the wings of the butterfly with my fingers. I took a closer look. This butterfly is very beautiful, especially its wings, just like the flowers blooming in spring. I wanted to take it home, but I thought about it: butterflies also have life, and they should be allowed to live freely in nature. Thinking of this, I let this little creature return to the blue sky. At this time, I looked at my hand again, and the silver-white powder was left on it. I thought, maybe this is the gift that the butterfly left me.
