My favorite denim jacket I like the little Deer Bana brand jeans. This denim is made of blue and white. The collar is semi-circular. The blue and white background is embroidered with two small yellow flowers. It is very beautiful. There are two pockets on the chest. There are two small red flowers, which look even more beautiful. In the middle of the clothes, there was a straight red zipper. In the lower part of the pocket is a cute Snoopy. It is wearing a purple sportswear with the number 3 written on it. It has a ball in its hand, a purple hat on its head, and a pair of black and white sneakers on its feet. The eyes are dark and small, like two little black beans. There are also two thin and long eyebrows on the eyes. A long nose is tilted outwards, and there is a small black nose on it. The corners of her mouth are tilted upwards, as if smiling at me. This denim jacket is stretchy. It is most suitable to wear it in spring and autumn. I really like this jeans! Because I look very spirited in it. This denim is made of blue and white.
