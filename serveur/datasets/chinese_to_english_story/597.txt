Tang Yin learned painting Tang Yin learned painting from the famous painter Zhou Chen when he was a teenager. One year later, he thought that his painting was indistinguishable from his teacher's painting. He felt that further study would be a waste of time, so he used the excuse to go home to take care of his parents. The teacher saw his mind and agreed. Before leaving, the teacher invited him to dinner and told him to study solidly. The teacher also said, "I drank wine, and I got some fever. Open the window cool and cool." Tang Yin saw the bamboo forest under the moonlight, which was very beautiful. He pushed the window with his hand, but couldn't push it. It turned out that the "window" was painted on the wall. He immediately understood, and said, "Teacher, I won't go." Later, he studied painting more diligently and became a famous painter in history. The teacher said again, "I drank alcohol, and some fever became hot. Open the window cool and cool.
