Fun at the Beach By this time, there were already many people on the beach. Some of them caught crabs, some caught sea fish, some picked shells ... I touched it in the sea, hey, a little starfish was caught by me! Hey, a little friend over there is looking down for something. I walked over and wanted to see what happened. The little friend just kept talking and kept silent. It turned out that a crab flees unwillingly and flees eastward. Suddenly, the little friend cried out, "Oh," it turned out that the crab caught his hand with a large stalk. Hey, why are my feet also itchy? Look down, oh, it turns out that a prawn is teasing me! It is swaying two long beards, like a military general on the stage. I stretched out my hand gently and squeezed it. The general became my captive, and I was no longer mad. Suddenly, the little friend cried out, "Oh," it turned out that the crab caught his hand with a large stalk.
