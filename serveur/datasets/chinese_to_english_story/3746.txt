Xiaohua's family recently installed a telephone. One day, my grandfather was sick, my father dialed 120 quickly, and the ambulance arrived soon. Xiaohua asked his father: "It's weird, why did you come to the ambulance as soon as you called?" Dad told Xiaohua: "120 is the emergency phone number, there are many service calls like this, such as 110 is the police band, 119 is The fire alarm phone, 114 is the number-checking phone, 121 is the weather forecast phone, and 122 is the road traffic accident alarm phone. "After hearing my father's words, Xiaohua felt that the phone can be really useful.
