The beautiful flower bed has a rectangular flower bed in the northwest corner of our school playground. In the center of the flower bed, there are several tall and fragrant "canna" plants. Its dark green leaves resemble a green banana fan. Its straight and straight stem dragged a few gorgeous crimson flowers, much like a slim young girl standing there! On both sides of the flower bed, there are two pomegranate trees. They seem to be two guards guarding the flower bed day and night. Around the flower bed, there are many potted plants, including the frosty winter wheat, the pink rose, the verdant chrysanthemum, and the beautiful Begonia, which is really beautiful! The flower bed in the school is so beautiful!
