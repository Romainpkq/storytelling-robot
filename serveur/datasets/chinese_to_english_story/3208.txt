Mischievous colorful light Sun Father has seven mischievous ray babies, their names are red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue and purple. The baby with colorful lights drilled in the clouds, dyeing the clouds in the sky into colorful clouds. When they had enough play in the sky, they sneaked to the ground to play secretly. They slid onto the sunflower, and the sunflower's face turned golden and golden. They came to the orchard again and put orange clothes on the oranges. They ran on the grass and the grass turned green. They jumped, jumped, jumped into the sea, and the sea became blue. After the colorful light baby took a bath and passed the beach, the little crab asked them if they were coming to the blue color and became a little blue crab. As soon as the colorful light babies came to the vegetable garden, Father Sun called them back home. Tomatoes and eggplants are anxious: "Leave us a beautiful color!" Colorful Baby kisses tomatoes and eggplants. Tomatoes have a red color, and eggplants have a purple color. When the baby of colorful light heard the father-in-law shouting again, he ran to the sky quickly, and a colorful glow of light appeared in the place where they ran.
