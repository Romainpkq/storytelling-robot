When it rains, the little white rabbit gathers mushrooms on the grass and has a good time. Suddenly, the wind blew and the rain started. The little white rabbit hurriedly picked a large tree leaf and placed it on the head as an umbrella, but the rain would not rain. Suddenly, it saw a chick drenched. "Chicks, come under the leaves!" So the chicks and the little white rabbit walked forward with the big leaves. They saw the kitten meowing again in the rain. "Little cats, come under the leaves!" So the three of them hid under the big leaves. The rain stopped, and they played happily together.
