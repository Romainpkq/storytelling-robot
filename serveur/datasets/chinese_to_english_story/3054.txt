In autumn, the trees are full of fruits. On the hillside, rows of persimmon trees are lined with persimmons like red lanterns. There is a wild fruit tree on the top of the mountain. These fruits are ripe, with red hawthorn; pea-sized tree heads red; and purple grapes. The most lovable thing is the golden lotus seed. You see its golden body is hidden in the green leaves. There are tiny thorns all over the body, which makes people afraid and like it. If you take a pill and remove the thorn, put it in your mouth to taste it.
