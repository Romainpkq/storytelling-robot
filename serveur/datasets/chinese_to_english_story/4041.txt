Cleft Lip Fish The Cleft Lip Fish is small and light in action. It treats the fish, not through medicine, but uses its pointed mouth to remove bacteria and necrotic muscles from the sick fish. In fact, the fish doctor uses the parasites and necrotic tissues of the sick fish to make delicious meals. In this way, the fish doctor can get a "remuneration"----a full meal, and the sick fish immediately relieves the pain, it really has its own Income. Biologically call this phenomenon "symbiosis". What is more interesting is that the relationship between the sick fish and the fish doctor is quite harmonious. All sick fish that come for treatment must be head-down, tail-up, and suspended in the water straight at the time of treatment. Fish medicine is indispensable in fish. As long as there is a fish doctor, the sick fish can be treated in time, and the phenomenon of death caused by disease will be greatly reduced.
