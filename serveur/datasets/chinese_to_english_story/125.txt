The camel grows tall, and the sheep grow short. The camel said, "High is better than short." The sheep shook their heads and said, "No, short is better than tall." They kept arguing about it. They walked to a yard. The garden was surrounded by walls, and many trees were planted inside, and the lush foliage protruded from the wall. The camel ate the leaves as soon as it looked up. The sheep lifted its forelegs and threw it on the wall. Its neck stretched out so long that it couldn't eat. The camel said, "Look, this proves that the taller is better than the shorter one." The sheep shook his head and refused to give in. They took a few more steps and saw a narrow and short door in the fence. The sheep walked into the garden to eat grass. The camel knelt down on its front legs, and lowered its head to drill into the door, but could not get in. The sheep said, "Look, this proves that short is better than tall." The camel shook his head and refused to give in. They asked Lao Niu for comment. The Lao Niu said, "You two only see your strengths and you don't see your weaknesses. This is wrong. Camel said," High is better than short.
