The beautiful lotus pond "Xiaohe only has pointed corners, and dragonflies have long stood on it." This is a poem I had memorized before, and I really saw this scene when I came to the pond. A pool of green lotus leaves was squeezed and swayed gently in the breeze. A lot of crystal dewdrops rolled on the lotus leaf and slipped into the water from time to time. A lot of bright lotus flowers emerged from the lotus leaf like a big disc, some were shyly wrapped in flower bones, and some bloomed pink petals, showing yellow stamens, exuding alluring Fragrance. Sister Dragonfly was already intoxicated by the beauty in front of her. She fluttered her wings and paused on the lotus leaf for a while to stop and admire it. Sometimes she smelled a scent on the lotus flower. I am embarrassed to say: "Without the background of Sister Lotus, how can I be beautiful!"
