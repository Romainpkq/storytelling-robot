Camels grow tall, and sheep grow short. The camel said, "Height is better than short." The sheep shook his head and said, "No, short is better than height." They kept arguing about it. The two of them walked to a yard. The garden was surrounded by walls, and many trees were planted in it, and the lush foliage protruded from the wall. The camel ate the leaves as soon as he looked up. The sheep raised its front legs and chopped it against the wall. His neck stretched out and he could not eat it. The camel said, "Look, this can be proved, taller than shorter." The sheep shook his head and refused to admit defeat. They walked a few more steps and saw a narrow and short door on the wall. The sheep walked into the garden in a big way to eat grass. The camel knelt down on her front legs, lowered her head and drilled into the door, but she couldn't get in. The sheep said, "Look, this can be proved, short is better than tall." The camel shook his head, and refused to admit defeat.
