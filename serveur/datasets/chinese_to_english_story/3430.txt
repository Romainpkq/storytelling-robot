Where are the ears? The mother of the frog asked the little frog to look at nature, where the ears of the animals grow. The frog Doudou caught a mosquito, the frog brightly held a locust, and the frog fatly caught a little cricket, but none of them found the ears of small animals. "They are all disabled and have no ears." The little frogs comforted themselves and threw mosquitoes, locusts and crickets on the ground. "Haha! Haha!" Little mosquitoes, little locusts, and little crickets were free. They couldn't help laughing in unison: "How do you know that we don't have ears?" "My tentacles are ears." Said the little mosquito. "My ears grow on my belly." The little locust patted his belly. "My ears are here!" Said the little cricket, raising the two calves in front.
