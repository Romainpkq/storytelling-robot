Clouds of Lushan The scenery of Lushan is very beautiful. There are peaks, valleys, waterfalls, and streams, especially the fickle clouds, which add a bit of mystery to it. When visiting the mountains, it seems that you can feel the floating clouds at your fingertips. When walking on the mountain roads, there is often a feeling of rising clouds and fog driving. The clouds and mists of Lushan are in various forms. Those clouds covering the top of the mountain are like white fleece hats worn on the top of the mountain; those clouds entangled in the middle of the mountain are like strips of jade tied around the mountainside. Clouds and mist pervade the valley. It is a vast sea. Clouds and mist cover the mountain peaks. It is a huge sky. Lushan's clouds are changing rapidly. The cloud in front of me was just a ray of light wafting in the wind, and in a blink of time it became a galaxy of nine days. It was a white horse with four hoofs and wind. It has nâ€™t waited for you to see it clearly. An iceberg floating on the Arctic Ocean ... the clouds and mists of Lushan The scenery of Lushan is very beautiful.
