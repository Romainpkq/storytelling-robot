Grandpa Zhang Leping is a famous painter in China. Grandpa Zhang's mother is an ingenious person who often embroiders and cuts paper for others. It was a quiet summer night, Zhang Leping snuggled beside her mother and watched her embroider. Suddenly, he discovered that a candle oil shed from the candle, much like a mother's embroidered chick. He hurried to catch it with his hands, but what he caught was warm, soft sludge. According to the pattern embroidered by his mother, he pinched a little white rabbit with oil sludge. He dug a little red oil from the red candle and embedded it in the eyes of the white rabbit. He shouted happily: "Mom, look at my little white rabbit!" Mom looked at his son's work and hugged him and said, "Okay, the little white rabbit you pinch is so beautiful!" With the encouragement of his mother, Grandpa Zhang Step by step into the door of art.
