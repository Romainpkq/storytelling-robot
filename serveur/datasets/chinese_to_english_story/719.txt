The scenery in Butterfly Valley is very charming. In some valleys, there is only a yellow butterfly. Under the sun's rays, it is golden and brilliant. In some valleys, there are several kinds of butterflies. They fly up and down, and they are colorful, just like who sprayed a handful of colorful petals in the air, which fluttered with the wind, and then with the wind.
