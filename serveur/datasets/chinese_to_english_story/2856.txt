October 28 is the birthday of the goat, many small animals came to congratulate him. They gave the little goat their most precious gift. Calves send milk, rabbits send radishes, chickens send greens, red pandas send bamboo leaves, and monkeys send peaches. Everyone eats, plays and sings together, so happy!
