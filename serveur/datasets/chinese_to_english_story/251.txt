A quiz was held in Banana Forest Elementary School, and many animals came to participate. The elephant teacher came up with such a question: How do three people eat two bananas? It didn't take long for the Gray Wolf, Fox and Goats to answer first. They are so divided. The Gray Wolves cut two bananas from the middle. Each person ate half of the bananas, and the remaining half was thrown away. No one wants to find them back. The gray wolf thinks this is the most fair. The fox team simply peeled both bananas. You bite and I bite and eat. After eating bananas, it is fair to have no more than one bite per person. What about the goats? Also cut the banana from the middle and give it to the elephant teacher half root first, and each person will eat half root. Smart boy, which team do you think won the first place? After eating bananas, it is fair to have no more than one bite per person.
