My favorite vegetable is cucumber. Cucumbers vary in shape, some are like the moon at the beginning of the month, some are like a curved banana, some are like a small grenade, and some are like a shiny silver sickle. They are also different in size, some are fat, some are thin and long, and some are not fat or thin.
