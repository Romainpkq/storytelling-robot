Autumn rain This morning, the weather was fine, but it rained in the afternoon. The raindrops crackled on the glass window, and immediately there were "water splashes" on the window glass, they jumped happily! Through the glass window, I looked out. There seemed to be huge curtains hanging in the heavens and the earth. The curtains were not made of cloth, but were made of rain silk. Through the rain curtains, the building opposite was blurred, and a long water-drop curtain was hanging under the eaves. In the rain, a leaf is formed like a watercolor without drying out. The grey sky is the background, and the bright wet leaves are the main characters in the painting. Some of the leaves hit the ground by the rain seemed to be leaning on their heads, looking at the companion on the tree, very sad. After the rain, the weather became significantly colder. One of the coats I was wearing seemed very thin and I quickly added a piece of clothing. Through the glass window, I looked out. There seemed to be huge curtains hanging in the heavens and the earth. The curtains were not made of cloth, but were made of rain silk.
