It 's so fun by the lotus pond. There is a shallow pond next to my house. The pond was covered with lotus leaves and filled with lotus flowers. The round and large lotus leaves, like a green umbrella that is spread out, are shaded when hiding inside. The pink lotus is more beautiful than any other flower. It grows in the middle of the green lotus leaves and dresses the small pond so beautifully! My friends and I like to play in the lotus pond most. Hidden in a large water basin, use your hands to paddle and paddle, sway, sway into the lotus, hide under the lotus leaf in the wind, and listen to the frog howling. It's raining, the rain hits the lotus leaves, and it clicks, like an "umbrella" that really rests on our heads!
