Some of the mothers of the earth do not love the children of the mothers of the earth. They cut trees, fold flowers, and destroy the grass. Mother Earth lost her child, she was naked, basked by the sun, and blown by the cold wind. After some days, Mother Earth became ill, her skin cracked, she gradually lost her luster, and the world became gray. Mother Earth hopes that we can cherish her and restore her glory.
