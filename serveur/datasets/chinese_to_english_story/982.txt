It's snowing, it's snowing again! It snowed and the snow covered the wheat with a quilt. It snowed, and the snow covered the ground with a silver carpet. It snowed, and the snow padded a terry jacket on the branch. It snowed and snow put a hat on the house. It snowed, and the snow replaced a flower, a grass, and a tree with a winter coat. It snowed and the snow put on the school playground. Mai laughed, the earth laughed, the branches laughed, the house laughed, the flowers and trees laughed, the playground also laughed ... it snowed, and the snow put a coat on the school's playground.
