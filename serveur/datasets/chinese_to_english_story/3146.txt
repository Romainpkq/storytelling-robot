What color is the sun? When the sun kisses an apple, the apple turns red. When the sun kisses the banana, the banana turns yellow. When the sun kisses the leaves, the leaves turn green. When the sun kisses the grapes, the grapes turn purple. So, what color is the sun? I think the color of the sun must be colorful. All the most beautiful colors in the world come from the sun. The world is beautiful, first of all because the sun is beautiful.
