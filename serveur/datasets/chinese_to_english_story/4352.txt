The cuckoo's floral skirt cuckoo lives in the tree hole of the old locust tree. Listening to the old locust tree, cuckoo used to have no flower skirt. It flew from east to west, and while flying, it was called "cuckoo, cuckoo, hurry cuckoo!" In the spring of the cuckoo's cries, the earth changed into green clothes. Large crops are connected to the orchard, high mountain terraces are like colored ladders, and green, pink, and pale blue flowers bloom on the green grass. Bees come to gather honey, butterflies come to dance. The lively river sings songs, and flows happily into the distance. Seeing that spring is so beautiful, the cuckoo is very happy. At this time, it was so tired that it quietly returned to its nest and slept. The next day, the cuckoo woke up and found himself wearing a floral dress. "What's going on?" It was surprised and happy. The old locust tree told Cuckoo: "Because you diligently call everyone Cuckoo, so Spring Girl and Mother Earth specially made a flower skirt for you." Cuckoo has a beautiful flower skirt, and it keeps coming every spring. Call people: "Cuckoo, Cuckoo, Hurry Cuckoo!"
