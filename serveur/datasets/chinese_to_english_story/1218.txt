Childhood question mark Childhood is a poem, childhood is a dream, childhood is a long string of question marks. There is an English boy named Newton. When he saw the apple falling from the tree, he thought: Why did the apple fall to the ground instead of flying to the sky? There is also an English boy named Watt. When he saw that the water was boiling and the pot lid could not stop jumping up and down, he asked his aunt, "Why does the pot lid dance?" As a child, he spent the time slowly in the question mark. Later, both Newton and Watt became great scientists. When he saw the apple falling from the tree, he thought: Why did the apple fall to the ground instead of flying to the sky?
