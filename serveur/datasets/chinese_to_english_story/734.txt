Once when I was appreciating the coins, I saw three Japanese characters "Japan" on Japanese coins. I didn't understand why Japan also used Chinese characters, so I asked my father. My dad said, "In the Tang Dynasty in China, we had cultural exchanges with Japan. At that time, Japan did not have a native language. When we saw the beautifulness of Chinese characters, we borrowed a part of them and created our own characters. Until now, there are still thousands of Thousands of Chinese characters are used in Japan. "At that time, Japan did nâ€™t have any native Chinese characters. When it saw the beauty of Chinese characters, it borrowed a part from Chinese characters and created its own characters. To this day, tens of millions of Chinese characters are used in Japan. .
