In some islands in Brazil and the Pacific, a tree that bears "bread" grows. The bread tree is more than ten meters high, the trunk is thick, the foliage is lush, and the thick shade is like a natural pergola. Every year from July to November, the tree will bear round fruits. The fruits are big like volleyball and small like tennis. The fruit turns green when tender and turns yellow when ripe. A tree often hangs hundreds of thousands of fruits like toasted yellow bread.
