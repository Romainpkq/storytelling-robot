There are three little goldfishes in goldfish learning. They look very beautiful. They find it very boring to swim in the water every day, so they decided to learn a little skill. A small goldfish with blistering eyes decided to build a house with a hermit crab. At first, it was careless. Later, it was caught by a hermit crab. After a lesson learned, it started to build a house seriously. The second red-tailed fish saw "Scavenger" (a kind of fish nickname) cleaning the environment, and felt that it was glorious to create a beautiful environment for everyone, so they decided to learn this line. At the beginning it was learned very seriously, but it didn't take long for me to get tired. It said: "Cleaning the environment every day, back pain, I can't stand it." In the end, it was only halfway. The third naughty little goldfish learns to swim with swordfish. As soon as the swordfish said the essentials of learning to swim, it swims impatiently. I thought: I will have these things for a long time, and there is nothing to learn. One month later, the blister-eye little goldfish learned something, and the other two little goldfish could only swim to and fro without success. The second red-tailed fish saw "Scavenger" (a kind of fish nickname) cleaning the environment, and felt that it was glorious to create a beautiful environment for everyone, so they decided to learn this line.
