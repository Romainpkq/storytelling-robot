Suddenly there was a lot of noise in the quiet courtyard of the snow, and the children seized the great opportunity to play happily. The little guy who was still in the arms of his mother, when he saw the snowflake, he reached out his chubby little hand to catch those "white butterflies". Those children who just walked away, got rid of their parents' hands, stepped on the snow by themselves, and listened to the "creak" sound. Some children look for places without footprints, and then look back to admire their "masterpieces." But we found some little friends, vigorously played snowball fights, tired of playing, just sit on the snow on the buttocks, grabbed a snow in our mouth when we were thirsty, and enjoyed the natural dew. The naughty Snowflake brother deliberately got into my neck collar, and the cool one was as happy as eating ice cream in the summer.
