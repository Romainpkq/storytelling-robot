After the mushroom umbrella rained, the mushrooms under the big tree stretched out small umbrellas, white, black, gray, and flowery, and many and beautiful. The big tree said: "Mushroom, who are you going to give this beautiful little umbrella to?" The little bee flew over, and the little mushroom said: "Send you a mushroom umbrella." The flower and butterfly flew over, and the little mushroom said, "Send you a mushroom umbrella." The flower and butterfly shook his head and said, "I do nâ€™t want it." The little yellow dog ran over, and the little mushroom said: "Send you a mushroom umbrella. Say no. A little white rabbit ran over and gave him a mushroom umbrella. Haha, the little white rabbit was so happy that she carried the mushroom umbrella home, and the mother rabbit said, "We are not afraid of rain this time."
