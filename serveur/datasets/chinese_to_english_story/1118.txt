My old cat is very concerned about his children. Every time he came back from the outside, he lay down to feed the kitten. When the little cats are feeding, it always licks their hair, as if they are bathing them. Which kitten is a little uncomfortable, the old cat will keep spinning around the kitten, and "mouth meowing" in his mouth, as if asking: "Little baby, where are you uncomfortable?" Tell your mother! "Which kitten is a little uncomfortable, the old cat will keep spinning around the kitten, and" mouth meowing "in his mouth, as if asking:" Little baby Where are you uncomfortable?
