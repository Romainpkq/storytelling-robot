In spring, I buried sunflower seeds in the dark mud, and the seeds germinated quietly in the ground. A few days later, tender young buds burrowed out of the ground. The longer and taller the sunflower, I had to look up to see it. In the summer, the sunflowers are blooming, golden. In winter, the sunflower seeds have matured and they are really full.
