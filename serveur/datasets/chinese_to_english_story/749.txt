The taste of the moon What is the taste of the moon? Is it sweet or salty? I really want to taste a small bite! At night, the animals looked at the moon and always thought so. However, no matter how much the neck, the hands, the legs are stretched, the moon cannot be reached. One day a little turtle was determined to touch the moon. Climbing to the top of the mountain, the moon was near. However, little turtles are still out of reach. The turtle called the elephant, "Elephant, come on my back, maybe we can get it!" Moon thought, "Is this a game with me!" The elephant's nose stretched up, and the moon was light Jump up to the ground. The elephant was out of reach. It called the giraffe. Then the giraffe called the zebra, the zebra called the lion, the lion called the fox, the fox called the monkey, and the monkey called the mouse. The moon looked at the mouse and thought, "Such a little bit, I can't catch me." The moon was tired of playing, and it didn't move this time. Unexpectedly, "click!" The mouse bit a piece of moon. It gave the animals a bite of the moon, and everyone felt that this was the most delicious thing they had ever eaten. A small fish looked at all this, and couldn't understand why: "Why do they have to work so hard to go to the high sky to pick the moon? Isn't there another one? Well, it's in the water, beside me." The elephant's nose stretched up, and the moon jumped up slightly.
