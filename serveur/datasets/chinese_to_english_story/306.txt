Brave and clever A little squirrel and three little kangaroos are playing under a fruit tree. The mother kangaroo is watching them not far away. Suddenly, a wicked wolf got out of the woods. The kangaroo mother's eyes are quick, she grabs two baby kangaroos and a baby squirrel, puts them in the pockets on her chest, and poses in a fight with the wolf. However, another little kangaroo was under a walnut tree that was far away and did not return to his mother's pocket in time. The evil wolf drooled and swooped at it. "Oh!" Something hit the head of the old wolf, and the evil wolf opened his mouth wide and looked up. "Oh!" Another thing caught his throat, the wolf was frightened, thinking it was the hunter's bullet, and ran away with his tail in his hands. Everyone looked up, and it turned out that it was the squirrel mother who threw walnuts on the tree. At this time, the little squirrel and the baby kangaroo jumped out of the mother kangaroo's pocket. The little squirrel said to the little kangaroo: "Your mother is brave!" The little kangaroo said to the little squirrel: "Your mother is so smart!" After hearing this, the kangaroo mother and the squirrel mother laughed. The kangaroo mother's eyes are quick, she grabs two baby kangaroos and a baby squirrel, puts them in the pockets on her chest, and poses in a fight with the wolf.
