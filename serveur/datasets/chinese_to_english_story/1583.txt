Moved, moved, the fish was fooled. Wow, it's as big as my palm. Dad said, let him go. The younger brother is too young. Moved, moved, and the fish was cheated. Wow, it's bigger than my dad's palm. I also said, let him go. Father Papa is too old. Hahaha, moved this again, probably a fish mother. She wants to go home and take care of the father of fish. She will miss the younger brother of fish and let her go. At dusk, we were empty-handed and relaxed, but our hearts were full of fish and our hearts were full. Moved, moved, and the fish was cheated. Wow, it's bigger than my dad's palm.
