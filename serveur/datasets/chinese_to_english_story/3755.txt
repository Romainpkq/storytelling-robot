In spring, the sun is shining, and flowers bloom in the fields. White pear blossoms, pink peach blossoms, and yellow rape blossoms exude bursts of fragrance. On Saturday, the Spring Animal Games were held in the forest. Some of the little animals are cycling, some are racing, some are playing football, and some are jumping high. The competition is really fierce!
