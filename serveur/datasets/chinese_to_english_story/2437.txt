In an instant, winter is here again, and the hedgehog is going to hibernate again. As soon as he closed the door, he heard someone knocking on the door. It turned out that the duck was watching it. The little duck said, "Brother Hedgehog, in order to cure your arthritis, I will weave together the wool that I usually shed and sew you a soft duck down, so that you can sleep warmly throughout the winter."
