Bless you, little swallow. In the early morning, I walked in the park and found a little swallow fell to the ground. I was determined to send it home. I was holding the little swallow carefully, holding my head sideways, and looking at the tree while walking. Suddenly, I found a "soil nest". Is that the nest of the little swallow? I take a closer look, yo, there are two big swallows in the nest! At this moment, the little thing couldn't help screaming, like, "Yes, yes, this is it!" But the big swallow flew away when she saw me. I put the little swallow under "Tu Wo Wo" and then hid behind the big tree and watched. I saw two big swallows gently falling beside the little swallows, called and how much, the three swallows were so affectionate! Watching their family reunite, I couldn't keep my mouth shut. what ! Little swallow, I bless you, I hope you can grow up smoothly and make a greater contribution to humanity. I was holding the little swallow carefully, holding my head sideways, and looking at the tree while walking.
