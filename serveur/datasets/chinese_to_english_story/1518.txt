On the way home, the traffic policeman always saw an uncle of the traffic policeman at the crossroads. He stood there with great vigor, wearing white gloves and gesturing to direct traffic. His hands were pointing east for a while and south for a while. Vehicles in all directions followed the direction of his hand and passed through the crossroads. I think: With the traffic police uncle, people who drive cars will definitely not be in trouble. His hands were pointing east for a while and south for a while. Vehicles in all directions followed the direction of his hand and passed through the crossroads.
