A lilac tree grows a lilac tree by the pond. In spring, lilac trees are full of lilac flowers. No matter who comes to the pond, he should smile and take a look at Ding Xianghua. One day, a melancholic man came to the edge of the pond. He folded a few branches of lilac and took it away. Some young people came to travel and washed their faces by the pond. When they set off, they folded many branches full of flowers. After a while, the people who came to the pond no longer smiled.
