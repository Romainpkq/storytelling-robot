Autumn creepers There are many creepers planted under the eaves behind the podium of our school. The creeper climbed along the wall and climbed up to the platform on the second floor. In summer, the tip of the green leaves of a wall is all down, very beautiful. When autumn comes, the leaves of the creeper turn red, and the green wall becomes a red wall, which is also more beautiful. The bunches of red leaves are like autumn maple leaves, like piles of small flames, like a red butterfly, and like the red sunset on that day. The mountain climbing tiger is in full bloom of bright autumn chrysanthemums and golden canons. All this became the brightest scenery in our school. We ran around under the eaves, playing freely, and the climbing tiger reflected our happy smile. so beautiful ! Parthenocissus in autumn.
