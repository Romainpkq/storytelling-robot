I love autumn fields It 's autumn, and there are a few white clouds floating in the high sky. Under the blue sky, the wild geese flew south, and they were lined with "one" for a while, and "people" for a while. The maple leaves in the distance turned red, like a red cloud. Near was a golden paddy field, and Rice smiled and bent over. The autumn wind came and the fields were rolling with golden waves. There is an orchard beside the paddy field. In the orchard are red apples, Huang Chengcheng's pears, and red persimmons with branches. I love autumn fields. There is an orchard beside the rice field.
