My puppy must write about our puppy first, it ’s called “Prince”, it ’s the most beautiful and furry dog ​​in our village, it ’s like a naughty boy, it can do everything, it runs It's so fast that I can't keep up with it. But "the prince" is very good, it is always waiting for me. "The prince" still laughs, but I have never seen him cry. I taught it how to read characters, but it didn't even learn a single letter, but it was quite classy. When I taught him to pronounce the word "dog", it barked most happily. It must be thinking, this is itself! "Prince" can still count, but only a total of two. It also hums and barks. "What are you doing?" I asked it as it hummed in front of me. "Prince" "Wang" shouted and shook his head to indicate that he wanted to go out. "What else do you want now?" I asked it as we stepped out of the yard. "Prince" called "Wang" again and ran towards the railway. "You should finish it once!" I ran behind it while being angry because I wanted to go there too. I even know what "Prince" wants to do there. It likes to run against the train. Every time it loses, it never cares. Whenever a new train starts, the "prince" thinks he can run and win it. When he couldn't run, he barked a few times. I don't know if it allowed the train to leave, or scolded the train. I couldn't tell the difference.
