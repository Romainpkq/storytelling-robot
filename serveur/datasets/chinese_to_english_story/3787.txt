Grandpa Dongdong rode on a donkey and came to us with a cold whip all the way from the remote Siberian plain. The earth became a huge refrigerator. I was a ice cream bar wrapped in a flower in the refrigerator. The sycamore turned into a gray coral, and the sparrow was a group of happy shuttle fish around the coral. The window became a beautiful screen, and frost flowers were the only butterflies on the screen that were sleeping and sleeping.
