The wonderful starry sky and the quiet night sky look very common, but as long as you observe carefully, you can discover many mysteries. I found that the stars are divided into groups. Some are like a reversed "2", some are like a pegasus, and some are like a violin. Recently, I have also met the "Mom" of "Little Bear Constellation"-"Big Bear Constellation". She is composed of seven stars, like a spoon, and there is a bright star on the handle of the spoon, which is Polaris. How wonderful is the starry sky.
