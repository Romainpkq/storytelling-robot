At night, the fireflies carrying lanterns covered the moon with clouds. The hot air on the ground is still evaporating, and the weather is still so hot. We all shook the fan to cool off in the yard. But the fireflies carried small lanterns and flew on the grass. Is it to lead the lost ants, or to light the textile girl who is on the night shift? Or ... fly, fly, fly over the blades of grass, and fly under the big tree, the fireflies are not afraid of heat, and they work hard. Photographs, photographs, small lanterns of fireflies, like stars in the fairy tale world, twinkling twinkling, so charming!
