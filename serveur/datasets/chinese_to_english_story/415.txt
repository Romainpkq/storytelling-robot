Moon Bay My home is in Moon Bay. Moon Bay is a beautiful village. In front of the village is a crescent-like river and a stone bridge over the river. The river slowly flowed around the village, and schools of fish swam around in the river. The clear river reflects small bridges, green trees and green mountains. There are many peach trees on the river bank. In spring, the trees are full of peach blossoms, looking far away, like a piece of green farmland. Behind the village is a mountain, and there is a tea tree on the hillside. Moon Bay is so beautiful! I love Moon Bay. Moon Bay My home is in Moon Bay. Moon Bay is a beautiful village.
