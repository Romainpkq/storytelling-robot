Unsurprisingly, the teacher came in an instant. When the teacher stepped into the classroom, she was shocked first, and then a beautiful smile appeared on her face. At this time, the class leader said a password: "Stand up!" Our classmates stood up and said in unison: "I wish the teacher a happy holiday!" The teacher said excitedly: "Thank you!" As soon as the teacher turned around, he saw the flowers on the blackboard. Balloons and colorful text, as well as greeting cards made by students themselves. The teacher was very happy and excitedly said, "Thank you! Thank you classmates!" Ah! This is really a happy holiday.
