To the mouse, I like you-a pair of smart eyes, pink ears. Although I love to do bad things, I still like you. If I come to your kingdom, I must ask you to wash your face, wash your hands, take a bath, and brush your teeth. Also teach you to work by yourself and don't sneak in when doing things. I also want to introduce you a friend-its name is cat.
