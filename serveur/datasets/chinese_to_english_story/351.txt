Little book lover Bing Xin, a contemporary literary master who has been intelligent and eager to learn since he was a child, especially likes listening to stories. In order to encourage her to study attentively, Yang Zijing, who was then the superintendent of her family, said to her, "Do your homework well. When you have finished your homework, I will tell you a story at night." 舅舅 The first book she told her It's the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The tortuous plot and the lively characters deeply attracted Xiao Bingxin. When I finish speaking, I always say it again. In order to be able to listen to the story of the "Three Kingdoms" every night, she studied harder and always did her homework fast and well. However, I often had something in the evening. I couldn't tell her "Three Kingdoms". Sometimes she stopped for several days, which made Xiao Bingxin very anxious. As a last resort, she had to pick up her "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms" to see, at this time she was only 7 years old. At first, she didn't understand most of them, so she swallowed the jujube, and looked at it scrupulously. Even if she didn't understand, sometimes she was mistaken by her. In this way, she slowly understood the contents of some books, she became more and more fascinated, after reading "The Romance of the Three Kingdoms", she also found "Water Margin" and "Liao Zhai Zhi Yi" ... The mother saw her and couldn't let go of it, afraid she was too young She tried to persuade her to go out and play, and she refused. My mother had to hide the books, but I didn't know what to do. Those books were always found out unconsciously. However, I often had something in the evening. I couldn't tell her "Three Kingdoms". Sometimes she stopped for several days, which made Xiao Bingxin very anxious.
