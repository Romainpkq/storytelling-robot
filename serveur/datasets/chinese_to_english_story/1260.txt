Where I lived in my hometown, the leaves would speak softly, the grass would shake his hand gently, and the flowers would smile with a red face. In the places where I lived as a child, the birds would sing happily, the streams would flow happily, and the sky would emit a fragrance. Where I lived as a child, a thin line popped out and quietly flew into my atrium, making me feel infinitely warm and full of sunlight. In the places where I lived as a child, the birds would sing happily, the streams would flow happily, and the sky would emit a fragrance.
