The little bear said: "I like gold, because the rice is golden and golden, it brings us a bumper harvest and joy." Xiao The chicken said: "I like red because the apples are red. The red apples are fragrant and sweet, symbolizing enthusiasm." The little squirrel said: "I like purple because the eggplant is purple, and purple symbolizes nobility." The teacher nodded and said, "Ah! Beautiful colors! How beautifully dresses our world!"
