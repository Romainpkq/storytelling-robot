A glorious list was hung next to the rice field catcher, which said: "The insect catcher: frog, toad." The frog became angry at first glance: "Isn't the toad the toad that the children hate? Is it an insect catcher." Evening The frog found Uncle Niu and said, "Uncle Niu, you are at the edge of the field all day, who said you can catch insects? Why is the toad on the honor list also an expert in catching insects? I work hard every day to catch insects, I have never seen that ugly Guy. "Uncle Niu said with a smile;" You catch insects during the day, who will take over at night, you know? "At this time, a toad jumped out of the grass. Uncle Niu said, "Look, it's coming to the night shift!" Toad began to catch insects, one after another. At first glance, the frog understood that he had blamed the toad by mistake, and the frog lowered his head embarrassedly.
