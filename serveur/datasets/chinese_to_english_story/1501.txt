Cute little white rabbit There is a cute little white rabbit in my family. Its name is Baibai. The white rabbit's whole body is white and snowy, with long ears, short tails, and a pair of red eyes, like two large rubies, which is very cute. Normally, he always likes to jump around, but as long as I give it radish, it stops quietly, picks up its big radish, does not raise his head, and keeps his mouth moving. Son is really interesting.
