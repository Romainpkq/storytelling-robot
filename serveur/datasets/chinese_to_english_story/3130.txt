In the past, several blind people touched an elephant. The man who touched the elephant's leg said: The elephant is like a pillar. The man who touched the elephant said: The elephant is like a wall. The man who touched the elephant's tail said: The elephant is like a snake. Everyone said they were right, and they were blushing.
