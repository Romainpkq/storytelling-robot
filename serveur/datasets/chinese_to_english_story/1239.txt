My good friend Recently, my father brought me a good friend. He is not tall, with square heads and large faces. Sit there quietly and talk very little. What a great skill he has! Every day, as soon as I get home, he becomes my best friend and teacher. We read books, drew pictures, and played games together ... my friend is awesome, without him he would not. Start the question right and fast, and tell him what he never forgets. He can keep me out of the house and know everything I want to know. How about my good friend? Boy, do you know who he is? My friend is awesome. He wouldn't be without him.
