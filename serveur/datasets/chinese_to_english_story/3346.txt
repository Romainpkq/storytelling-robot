Fun zoo This afternoon, my mother took me to the zoo to see the animals. The zoo is really lively, with all kinds of animals. The naughty monkey is swinging on the big tree. The monkey was naughty and jumped around, making everyone laugh. On the grass, the cute giant panda is eating green bamboo leaves. In the pool, sea lions are performing heading, and from time to time there are applause from tourists. On the blue lake surface, two white swans are plucking their red feet and playing happily. In the sky, the bird flapped its wings and flew freely.
