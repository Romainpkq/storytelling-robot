Look at the geese, the white geese is here: stretching their necks and flapping their wings, "quack" screaming, all white, with only a little yellow on the head and claws. The small eyes are slick, and the flat mouth is always pecking. It's so cute! I love white geese, but I hate its overbearing. It always relied on its own strength and strength, so that the chickens, ducks, dogs, cats at home were subdued, and if it was a little disobedient, it was forced by force. Those chickens, ducks, dogs and cats have become its "slaves." When eating, other "slaves" can eat some leftovers only when it has a big belly, a round waist and flapping its wings to leave. Every time I see this situation, I have anger towards it shouted: "You damn slave, now day and age, I do not knock your block off." I love goose, but hate its overbearing .
