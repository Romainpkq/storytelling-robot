Multifunctional Bridge I am a bridge engineer and I designed a multifunctional bridge. It can move, it will stretch and shorten, it will rise and fall. When the water is heavy, I can erect this bridge on the water at any time. If the river water rises again, the bridge I designed will also rise, and it will not affect the vehicles driving on the bridge. If the river recedes, I will lower the bridge again, shorten it, and transport it back to the warehouse. When the water is heavy, I can erect this bridge on the water at any time. If the river water rises again, the bridge I designed will also rise, and it will not affect the vehicles driving on the bridge.
