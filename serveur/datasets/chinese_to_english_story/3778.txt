Ants repaying in a hot summer day, an ant was blown into the pond by the wind, and died on the evening, a pigeon on the tree saw this scene. "Good pity! Go help him!" The pigeon hurriedly threw the leaves into the pond. The ants climbed onto the leaves, and the leaves floated to the edge of the pool, and the ants were saved. "Thanks to the rescue of the pigeons!" Ant always remembers the life-saving grace of the pigeons. After a long time, a hunter came and aimed the pigeon on the tree with a gun, but the pigeon didn't know anything at all. At this time the ant climbed up on the hunter's foot and took a bite. "Oh! It hurts! Ah!" When the hunter hurt, the bullet was distorted. So that the pigeon escaped, and the ants also repaid the pigeon's life-saving grace.
