When Kong Rong was a child, his family often bought pears. The pears were fragrant and sweet. Everyone was battling to get big food. But Kong Rong takes the smallest one every time. The father asked him why he wanted the younger one. He replied: "Because I am younger, of course I should take the younger one and leave it to my elder brother to eat well." The father listened and praised him for being polite when he was young.
