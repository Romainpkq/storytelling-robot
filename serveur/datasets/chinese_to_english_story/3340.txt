On the hillside, there are green grass, wild flowers blooming, and a few lambs are eating grass. There is a small river on the slope, and the river is clear, and a group of fish play freely in the river. On the river, a pair of white geese swim around. In the distance, a shepherd boy played a flute on the cow's back.
