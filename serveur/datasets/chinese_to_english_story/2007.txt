Fighting little crab In the blue bay, there is a little crab, which relies on a pair of clips, so it is always good to bully others. The little fish was caught in it and shouted at her mother. The little tortoise was too afraid of him to stretch his head out. Shrimp ran far away when he saw it. Seeing everyone fearing it, the little crab was very proud and raised his head to spit bubbles. Suddenly, it found a small iron rod and thought, "Who dares to mess with me? See how I hold you!" "Haha!" A little boy cried, "I caught a little crab."
