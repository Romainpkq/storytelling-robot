A glorious list was hung next to the rice-catching expert rice paddy, which read: "The insect-catching expert: frogs, toads." The frog was angry at first glance: "Toad, isn't it the toad that children hate? What kind of insect-catching expert?" The frog found Uncle Niu and said, "Uncle Niu, you've been by the field all day. Who do you say will catch bugs? Why is the toad on the glory list also a bug catcher? I work hard every day to catch bugs. I have never seen that ugly Guy. "Uncle Niu said with a smile:" You catch worms during the day, who will take over at night, you know? "At this time, a toad jumped out of the haystack. Uncle Niu said, "Look, it's night shift!" Toad started catching worms, catching one after another. When the frog looked at it, it became clear that it had mistaken Toad by itself, and the frog lowered its head in embarrassment. Uncle Niu said with a smile: "You catch worms during the day, who will take over at night, you know?"
