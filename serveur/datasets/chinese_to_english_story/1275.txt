My home is in Hainan Island, where there are more fruits! There are bananas, candied fruits, watermelons, etc., and coconuts that I like. Coconut trunks are straight and tall, with a cluster of wide and long leaves on top of the tree, like a long fan. Below the long leaves, a bunch of coconuts grew. The dark green ones just came out, the light green ones started to mature, and the brown ones were ripe. Below the long leaves, a bunch of coconuts grew.
