So, all kinds of chrysanthemums bloom in the garden Yes, there are yellows, there are whites ... The autumn girl came to the grass happily and said to the grass: "You should also change your clothes, lend me your green shirt, I want to put on my cypress friends The wind is cold. "So the grass was yellow and the cypresses on the campus and the road were greener. The autumn girl came to the animal park lightly and urged the little swallows and geese to say, "Hurry up and prepare, go to the south!" So, the little swallows and geese flew in the blue sky.
