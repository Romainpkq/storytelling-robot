On Sunday afternoon, I sat on the balcony and painted. I first drew a piece of forest on paper with a green watercolor pen. The forest is green and the trees are very dense. I drew the blue sky above the forest again. There are white clouds floating in the sky. Then, I drew a few birds in the forest with yellow feathers and pointed mouths, which is very interesting. Finally, I gave the picture a name: "The Bird's Home".
