The little crow loves her mother. After her mother's careful nurturing, the little crow gradually grows up. It grows into a big and strong crow. The mother of the little crow gradually grew old and could not fly. The little crow flew out every day to find food for her mother. Whether it is a strong wind blowing loudly or a heavy rain falling down, the little crow is not afraid at all. It flew from east to west, and from south to north. When it found something to eat, it came back and fed it to its mother bit by bit. When my mother is full, she eats by herself. The little crow loves its mother so much!
