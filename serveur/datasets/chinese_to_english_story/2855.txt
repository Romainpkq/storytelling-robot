Kingfisher (excerpt) Kingfisher likes to rest on the reeds by the water, and a pair of small red claws hold the reeds tightly. Its color is very bright. The feathers on the head resemble a turban in the shade of emerald, embroidered with emerald green patterns. The feathers on the back resemble a light green coat. The feathers on the abdomen are like auburn shirts. It is small and exquisite, with a pair of sharp and long mouths under its translucent and flexible eyes. Kingfisher's song was crisp, and love fluttered against the surface of the water. With a blink of an eye, it stopped gently on the stalk. It gazed motionlessly at the microwave-filled water, waiting for the small fish to swim to the surface.
