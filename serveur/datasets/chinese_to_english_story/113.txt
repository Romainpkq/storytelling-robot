what ! The sunset is so beautiful, it looks like a steed in Mercedes-Benz, roars like a lion, and blooms like flowers for a while ... I look at it, my body feels fluttering, as if I have become a piece of sunset. After a while a ray of light came in, and the evening glow shone brilliantly. I opened my eyes slightly. Seven colors of red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple suddenly appeared in front of my eyes. It seemed that my body was wrapped in color. I looked and looked, my body felt light and fluttering, as if I had become a sunset.
