My little paradise This summer, my dad built a small flower house with many flowers in it, including camellia, chrysanthemum, pomegranate, asparagus, cactus ... the most are azaleas. Dad also built a small pool in the flower room. My father and I caught a lot of small fish in the small river and put them in the pond. I often feed them. As soon as I put the rice grains in the pool, the small fish will swim over and grab the rice grains at once. Dad also built a small pool in the flower room.
