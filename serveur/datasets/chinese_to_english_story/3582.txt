In the early winter of Mist Girl, Mist Girl flew around with a white yarn around her. She came to a beautiful garden and covered the flowers with layers of white gauze. The flowers said, "Thank you, Mist Girl, we are thirsty, and you brought us dew." Mist Girl came to the winding road again. She thought: Let me dress up the road. She draped the white gauze one by one on the road, he thought the road was more beautiful. But the highway said: "Mist Girl, don't do this, the car sister will have an opinion." Sure enough, the voice of the car sister came: "Mist Girl, your kindness will make me see the road, you should go back!" The girl was uncomfortable and wailed, and her tears fell on the ground. At this time, Father Sun came out. He stretched out two warm big hands to help Wuwu girl wipe away her tears, comforting her and saying, "Child, you should rest!" Wuqi girl hugged the white gauze and flew away with a smile.
