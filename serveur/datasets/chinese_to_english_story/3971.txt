The night of the square When the night falls and the stars are all over the sky, the beautiful Bigui Square is always lively. On festive nights, the square looks more lively than usual. People took advantage of the "May 1" leisure time to come here one after another. The fountain in the center of the square seems to be sprayed higher. Looking at the spring water it sprayed, it was more splendid under the colorful lights. The springs spouted out were various, some resembled fireworks, and sprayed out dense water mist; some resembled water polo, spinning beautiful dances in the air; some resembled meteors, and slowly fell after shooting into the sky . The beautiful fountain is accompanied by the crisp sound of music, so that people can't help but stop to watch.
