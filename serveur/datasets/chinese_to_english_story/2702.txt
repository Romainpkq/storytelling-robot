In the green vegetable fields of snails and earthworms, a snail crawled by the corner of the wall. The earthworm saw it and asked, "Brother Snail, where are you going?" The snail said: "I'm going to the top of the wall to see what's in the distance." The earthworm suddenly laughed. Go up? Do n’t be illusory! You crawl slowly! ”The snail ignored it. Slowly climbed up the wall. The earthworm thought the snail was too ridiculous and went to bed. The earthworm wakes up. I can't see the snail anymore. It turns out that the snail has already climbed to the top of the wall.
