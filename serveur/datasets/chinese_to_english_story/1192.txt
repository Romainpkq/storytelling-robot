Little Bug's Name A hard-shell bug lived in the grass. Although the worm is small, it looks very energetic. Butterflies flew by, bees flew by, and they all sighed and said, "What an amazing little bug!" The little bug was very proud. The little bug had no name yet. He really wanted to get a good, loud name for himself. Little Worm thought for three days and three nights, and came up with a name that she thought was pretty good. He said to the little butterfly that flew over here, "I'm an airy little bug. My name is a lion." Little Butterfly heard it, and almost broke the two whiskers on her head. She said, "I never saw I have passed such a small lion. "This made Xiao Zong feel embarrassed, and he had to think of a name for himself. He said to the little bee flying around, "I'm a godly worm, my name is a peacock." The little bee heard it, and almost laughed off his two transparent wings. She said, "Are you as big as a peacock? Do you have a big peacock tail?" The worm was so embarrassed that he hid in the grass and never thought about it again. At this time, the little butterfly and the little bee said, "We shouldn't just joke about the little bug, we should help him get a good name." After a few days, the little butterfly and the little bee came over and said, "Awesome little bug, we are for you Take a nice name, your name is Jin Shell, because your hard shell is shining gold in the sun! "" Okay, this name is so good! "Little Worm happily sang her own song "Golden Shell, Golden Shell, the name is very beautiful, Gold Shell, Gold Shell, I like the name." Little butterflies and bees are also happy for the small bugs to have such good names. He said to the little bee flying by, "I'm a maggot, my name is a peacock.
