Autumn park, autumn, the park is so beautiful! All kinds of chrysanthemums are blooming, some are red, some are yellow, some are white, and some are blue, they are so beautiful! The sweet-scented osmanthus is also blooming. The little ones are yellow and yellow, and they also emit a burst of fragrance. The leaves of the sycamore tree turned yellow and fluttered down one by one like a beautiful butterfly flying in the air. The leaves of the maple tree are red. From a distance, like the fiery clouds, the pine and cypress trees are still so green, standing high up like the soldiers on guard in the wind and rain.
