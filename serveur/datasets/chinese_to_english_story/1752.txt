Girl and mirror There is a girl named Xiaohua, wearing a flower skirt and pigtails, facing the big mirror and asking, "What am I like?" On the willow outside the window, there was a flower magpie, rushing to answer: " Alas, his face looks like a flower! "Xiaohua laughed. On the poplar outside the door, a black crow stepped in and said, "Well, his face looks like a winter melon!" Xiaohua heard and cried.
