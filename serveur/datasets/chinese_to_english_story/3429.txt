The old man on the calendar stepped on the sound of firecrackers and flew with the snowflakes. Look, who is coming to us? Ah, it is the old man of the calendar who came to his side. The old man of the calendar is so nice, he gave us a gift. Not a big holiday cake, not a sweet and refined toffee. It is a thick new calendar with a total of 365 sheets. Give us 365 suns, give us 365 moons. Going to school in summer teaches us not to be afraid of heat, but reading early in winter teaches us not to be afraid of frost. Accompany us throughout the year, study hard, and improve every day. Ah, how precious is the gift of the old man of the calendar, we must cherish it in our hearts. Let each one become a sail, leading us to sail every day in the sea of ​​knowledge.
