Dandelion's umbrella Dandelion is as white as snowflakes and as light as cotton wool. How beautiful it is, your little flying umbrella! Alas, it is a pity that your umbrella is too small. Otherwise, you can take me, take my little deer, fly, fly, fly over wide rivers, fly over high mountains, fly to grandma's house, and have a happy Sunday!
