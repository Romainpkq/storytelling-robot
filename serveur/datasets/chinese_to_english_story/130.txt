My favorite vegetable is cucumber. Cucumbers come in different shapes, some like the moon at the beginning of the month, some like a curved banana, some like a small grenade, and some like a shiny silver sickle. They are also different in size, some are fat and bulging, some are long and thin, and some are not fat or thin. My favorite vegetable is cucumber.
