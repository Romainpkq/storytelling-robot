Mouse meeting! One day, the kitten wanted to build the house next to the mouse's house, and the kitten and the mouse became neighbors. Kittens are the enemies of mice. This can hardly damage mice. The mice hate and fear the little cats. Now they have become neighbors. The mice dare not go out all day. What can we do? Rat King thought and thought, and finally came up with a solution. So he called the mice together to hold a meeting to discuss how to deal with cats. Rat King suggested that everyone hang a bell around the cat's neck. In this way, as soon as the cat came out, the mice would know. But, who can hang this bell? Everyone wants to come and go. Finally, the rat king sent elves capable mice Mimi to complete this sacred task. It turned out that unfortunately, the mice were bitten to death by the cats. From then on, the mice became more afraid of the cats.
