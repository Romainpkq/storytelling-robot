My little cousin, my little cousin, is less than a year old. She doesn't speak, she just cries loudly. Chubby face, big round eyes, very cute. She wore a small wooden fish on her wrist and made a crisp noise with every movement. Whenever he saw me, he always smiled. I teased her with a toy, but it treats the toy as delicious and sends it to my mouth. It is silly and really funny. When she was not happy, she pulled my hair hard with her hand, and she said babble in her mouth, but I do nâ€™t blame her because she is my little cousin .
