There was a fog in the morning on the mountain road. The road could not be seen clearly in the mountains. The pigs, deer and rabbits were badly damaged. The little rabbit leads the little pig, and the little pig pulls the little deer, pulling the vine, holding the tree, walking the mountain road step by step. Qiufeng's mother-in-law came to help, and —————— blew all the mist all at once.
