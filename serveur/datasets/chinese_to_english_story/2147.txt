Mother Chun came back and brought three mischievous little girls. Girl Lei likes to play with drums, wakes up the sky, wakes up the fields, and wakes up the sleeping mountains and villages. The rain girl likes to sprinkle water to play, washing the green trees, washing the grass, washing the faces of the flowers one by one. The wind girl likes to play with blowing air, blowing the branches softly, blowing the grass, and blowing the spring forward. Ah, spring is back. Mother Chun brought three capable little girls.
