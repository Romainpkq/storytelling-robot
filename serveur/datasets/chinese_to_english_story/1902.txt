Hands and mouth speak for a day. The hand said, "My ability is so great, I made many things in the world." I rushed and said, "I also have credit!" The hand laughed and said, "What's your credit? I don't Give you something, you don't even have anything to eat. "Mouth said angrily:" I eat, but also for everyone, if I don't eat, can you still move? "He heard, very angry. He no longer gave anything to stutter, and his mouth did not ask him for it. After a few days, I couldn't hold anything in my hand. What about my mouth? Can't move anymore. "I rushed and said," I also have credit!
