Qi Baishi is a famous painter in China. He cherishes time very much. He never wastes time. He has always used the phrase "do not teach to spend a day" to strictly demand himself. Once, Qi Baishi celebrated his 90th birthday. He was busy until very late before sending off the last group of guests. At this time he thought, today the task of drawing has not been completed yet, he should finish drawing before going to sleep, so he picked up the pen to draw. After repeated persuasion by his family, he went to rest. The next day, Qi Baishi got up early, and his family was afraid that he would be exhausted, so he persuaded him to take more rest, but he insisted on making up the five paintings of yesterday.
