Beautiful campus I have a beautiful campus. Standing in the middle of the campus and looking out to the east, there is a large playground. We often raise the national flag, take physical education classes, do class activities, etc. on the large playground. To the south is a red building. We call it the "Arts Building". It contains not only art classrooms, music classrooms, but also a large library and reading room. The gate to the west of the campus is where we go in and out of school every day. There is a beautiful fountain in front of the school gate. The water spray from the fountain is so clear and clear that every time we pass by it, we can't help but stop. To the north of the campus is our teaching building. The teachers are spacious and bright, clean and tidy, and we study hard in them every day. After class, we went chasing and playing on the big playground in the east. On the path of the campus, there are trees and flowers, and I like our beautiful campus so much.
