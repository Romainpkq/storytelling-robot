The small tree came through the winter, and the northwest wind was blowing, and we put on a cotton coat. Dad said: "We are cold, and the little tree is cold too. We should help the little tree to survive the winter safely." As Dad brought straw and rope, I quickly followed Dad to the little tree. We first wrapped the trunk of the small tree with straw, and then tied it carefully one by one with a rope. Looking at the small tree in front of me, I said happily, "The small tree is not afraid of wind and rain when it is wearing a winter coat." As my father brought straw and rope, I quickly followed my father to the small tree.
