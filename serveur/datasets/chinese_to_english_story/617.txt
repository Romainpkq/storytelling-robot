The breeze in March whispered the good news to a cloud. Yuner was carrying many small raindrops. The raindrops crackled down and told the good news of a flower on the apple tree. The little bee collecting honey heard the good news and hummed a song to tell every dandelion on the hill. Dandelion didn't say a word, their golden faces smiled in the sunshine after the rain. Everyone now knows the good news-spring is here. Dandelion didn't say a word, their golden faces smiled in the sunshine after the rain.
