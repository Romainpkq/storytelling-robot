Dandelion's umbrella Dandelion is as white as snowflakes and light as cotton. What a lovely look, your little flying umbrella! Alas, unfortunately your umbrella is too small. Otherwise, you can take me, take my little deer, fly, fly, fly across the wide river, fly over the high mountains, fly to your home, and have a happy Sunday! Alas, unfortunately your umbrella is too small.
