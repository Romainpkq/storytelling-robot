Happy holiday "June 1" Children's Day is here, children can be happy! This year's festival is really rich. Some of them have performed programs, some have organized entertainment activities, some have watched cartoons, and have received exquisite gifts! The happiest thing for me is that I became the ceremonial lady of "June 1" and presented a red scarf to the uncle Mayor who spent the holidays with us. The mayor uncle said kindly, "Thank you, children, and wish you a happy holiday!" I was so happy that I didn't know what to say. "June 1" is really happy, and I will never forget it.
