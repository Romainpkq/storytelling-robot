The good buddy bear was sick and was admitted to the hospital, and all the buddies came to visit it. The little monkey came and sent peaches to the bear, bees flew, and honey to the bear. The lark also flew, and it brought a beautiful song to the bear. The bear was very moved and said in a row: "Thank you, thank you!"
