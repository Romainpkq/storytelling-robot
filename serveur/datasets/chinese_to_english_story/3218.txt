Light rain, well, it's raining. Light rain polished the highway, light rain polished the roof, light rain also polished my shoes. By the way, it's raining. Light rain polishes the big tree, light rain polishes the big mountain, light rain polishes my umbrella. Light rain is a small brush, light rain is a mirror, light rain is like a nose. Wow, wow, rain grows up.
