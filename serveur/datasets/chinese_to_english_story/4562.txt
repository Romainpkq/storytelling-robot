The lovely autumn doll, the autumn doll is waving with colored pens. It draws naughtily and the earth changes its color magically. One by one the leaves were yellow and the fruits were ripe. A piece of rice is golden, and the colorful autumn chrysanthemums make me laugh. Qiuhua, stay here for a while, okay? I want to keep these wonderful scenes forever. But it was too late because Sister Dong was coming soon. So, goodbye, Qiuhua, let's meet again next year!
