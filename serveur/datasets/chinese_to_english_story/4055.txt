In the tail race forest, animals must hold a tail race. There are really a lot of animals that sign up for the competition! On the day of the game, the forest is lively! The referee, the old monkey, announced the start of the game, and saw the woodpecker flying to the pine tree, supporting his body with his tail, as if sitting on a small bench, and then hooking the bug out with his pointed mouth! At this time, the little squirrel hurriedly jumped onto the pine tree to perform his own program-skydiving. He opened his big fluffy tail and jumped from the tree, just behind the old monkey. Next to participate in the competition are yellow cattle, swallows, capuchin monkeys ... The game is over, but the old monkey scratched his scalp and said: "All are useful tails, who should the champion be?"
