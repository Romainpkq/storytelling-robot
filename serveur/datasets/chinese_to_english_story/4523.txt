A spider is weaving the web. It had just been woven a few times, and a strong wind blew it, breaking the silk. The spider woven it again, just halfway through it, and a raindrop hit it, breaking the web. The spider was not angry, and weaved again, but a burst of hail smashed the web again. The spider is not discouraged, but weaves again. Weaving, weaving, and finally weaving â€” a large, strong web. The spider sat happily in the middle of the web, catching the flying insects.
