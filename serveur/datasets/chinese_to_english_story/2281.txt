Lantern watching today is the Lantern Festival. After dinner, I followed my mother on the street to watch the lantern. Along the way, all kinds of small colored lights dazzled people. Look, the colorful lights are shining like small stars with blinking eyes. The white jade lamp is more striking. It rises into the sky like a moon in the sky and illuminates the road brightly. The colorful neon lights are bright and colorful, which makes the pedestrian street very beautiful. The most fascinating thing is the lights under a few big trees. At the beginning, I was still thinking, it is still early spring, how come the leaves on these big trees come so close together, the light under the tree is green. The light, the green, the green, reflected on the big tree, and the leaves of the tree immediately turned green, like a layer of jade.
