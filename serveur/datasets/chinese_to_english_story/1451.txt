Cute little cat There is a little cat in my family. The cat 's small ears are straight and their eyes are round. It has eight beards near its mouth, which are thin, long, and stiff. I know that it is used to measure the size of a rat's hole. The little cat is full of yellow and black patterns. Only four of the claws were white, and there were five small claw-like claws on it, and there was no sound when walking. It also has a long tail that always swings back and forth. During the day, the little cat always loves to sleep, and keeps snoring in her mouth. In the evening, it walked here, and looked there, as if spying on mouse activity. I really like this cute little cat. In the evening, it walked here, and looked there, as if spying on mouse activity.
