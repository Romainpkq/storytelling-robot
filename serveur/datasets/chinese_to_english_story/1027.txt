Moonlight Tonight, I am very comfortable. I have eaten dinner and lay quietly on a chair on the balcony while enjoying the cool moonlight while enjoying the beautiful moonlight. In the soft moonlight, the river that had been running for a day calmed down. The moon was reflected on the river, and when the evening breeze blew, it shimmered like a ribbon of gemstones. The moonlight shrouded the earth in smoke and mist. Yueer is a kind and most emotional girl. Whoever has sorrow, she will look at you with compassion, share your sorrows, and even pull half a cloud of white to cover her crying face. Yue Er is also a happy and cheerful girl. She hides in the white clouds and hides and hides with the stars, and sometimes tells the stories to the stars. The stars can hear their eyes blink. I like the moonlight like the night sky like water. Yue Er is also a happy and cheerful girl. She hides in the white clouds and hides and hides with the stars, and sometimes tells the stories to the stars. The stars can hear their eyes blink.
