Cats and mice a long time ago, cats and mice were a pair of intimate friends. They played together and farmed together. In the first year, they grow radishes. The mouse said to the cat: "You take the stem and leave the root for me!" Soon the radish grew and the mouse gave the stem to the cat. As the mouse chewed the crisp radish, the cat was greedy drooling. The next year, they planted lettuce. "This time you take the stem and give me the root!" The cat insisted. "Yes, it's up to you!" The mouse readily agreed. The green lettuce grew taller, and the mouse gave the cat a root. Seeing the mouse biting the tender lettuce, the cat glared dry. In the third year, they planted daylily. The cat said, "I want both roots and stems. Will you plant with me?" "Yes!" Said the mouse with a smile. The flowers in the garden opened, and the mouse gave the cat a stem and a root. Watching the mouse tasting the golden flowers with pride, the cat rushed towards the mouse angrily ... Since then, the cat and the mouse have become enemies. As long as the cat sees the mouse, it will grind its teeth and chase after it. As for the mice, they can only run away in vain!
