It turned out that the monkey lab technician forgot to write the name. The little monkey was crying anxiously. The flower dog said: "Don't worry, the turquoise is the blood of the spider, the light blue is the blood of the snail, the cyan is the blood of the shrimp, and the rose red is the blood of the earthworm. Name, and said, "I'll be serious in the future." The monkey lab technicians took their blood out and placed them in glass tubes.
