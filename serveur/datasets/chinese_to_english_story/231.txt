Clouds are in the sky like sapphire, and white clouds like snow are floating. They float leisurely in the blue sky, and a cloud changes its image in the air. Sometimes, the cloud resembles a little goat, and after running freely, it merges into the clouds soon; sometimes, the cloud resembles a bird flying from a distance, it expands little by little, and gradually blurs, Into a big cloud. At different times, the clouds have different changes. Some look like cows, some look like rabbits, and some look like chickens ... In the morning, the sun rises to the clouds with a beautiful gold rim, through the gap between the clouds, the sun shoots out The golden light shines in the wilderness, shining on the balcony of my house. At night, the little stars blinked. A few clouds in the sky were slowly swimming, blocking the little stars like a light streamer. No wonder I saw some stars when I walked. Clouds are in the sky like sapphire, and white clouds like snow are floating. They float leisurely in the blue sky, and a cloud changes its image in the air.
