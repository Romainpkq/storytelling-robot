Hands and mouth for one day, hands and mouth talk together. The hand said: "My skills are so great, I made many things in the world." The mouth rushed and said: "I also have credit!" The hand said with a laugh: "What credit do you have? I don't Give you something, you do n’t even have anything to eat. ”The mouth said angrily:“ I eat, but also for everyone. If I do n’t eat, can you still move? ”Hearing, he was very angry. He no longer stutters anything, and does not ask him for his mouth. After a few days, I can't hold anything in my hand, what about my mouth? Can't move anymore.
