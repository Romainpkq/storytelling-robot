A deer and a lion are beside the clear spring, and a deer is bowing its head to drink water. The water surface is like a mirror, which clearly reflects the figure of a deer. The deer first looked at a pair of beautiful long horns above his head. This was his most proud place. Look again at the two thin legs on the water surface, supporting the body weakly, and the deer can't help but feel discouraged. Lu Zhengsi froze, and suddenly found a lion behind him was chasing him. A sense of self-protection drove him to run away. His thin legs ran light and flexible, leaving the lion far behind. The lion desperately wanted to catch up, but the two thick legs were powerless, and he could only watch the deer escape and watch. Due to panic, the deer continued to run and ran into the jungle. Unexpectedly, the branches in the jungle tripped the two high horns of the deer. The deer was desperately struggling, but still couldn't get rid of it, instead it made a loud noise. The lion came after him from behind. The lion darted at the deer and caught it. Deer said before dying: "What I thought was bad looks saved me, but what I trusted so much killed me." Deer said before dying: "What thought bad looks saved me, and What I trusted so much killed me.
