Why the morning and evening sun is so special The red sun rises early in the morning or when it is about to fall in the evening, it is always red, like the cute faces of children. It turns out that the atmosphere dyes the sun: red. The sun's light is composed of 7 colors of red, orange, yellow, green, blue, blue, and purple. When these 7 colors of light are lined up neatly together When it appears, we see white light. We know that there is a thick atmosphere around the earth. There are a lot of dust and small water droplets in this atmosphere. When the sun hits the earth, we must cast it first. Through the atmosphere, the naughty little guys such as dust and small water droplets will spread the sun light, or simply block it back. In the morning or evening sun, almost only the red and orange lights bravely break through the atmosphere that blocks them, and enter Our eyes, so the sun we see in the morning and evening is always red.
