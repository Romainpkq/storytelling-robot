Whenever I go out in winter, my grandmother always wears her gray woolen cap. But today, she only wore a scarf. She said, "A hole has been ripped in the hat, so I need to make up for it." I looked at the woolen cap, thought about it, ran back to the house, pulled out a pair of cotton gloves I had worn as a kid, and removed the top A small flower, compared, and found that it is suitable to put in the hole in the grandmother's hat! I carefully stitched my hat with a thread and put it on my grandmother's bed. At night, I heard my grandmother's shout: "Who helped me make up my hat? Beautiful and warm!" I smiled secretly, this is my little secret, to hide in my heart. Whenever I go out in winter, my grandmother always wears her gray woolen cap.
