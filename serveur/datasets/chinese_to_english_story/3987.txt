The frog sits in the well. Little birds came and landed on the edge of the well. The frog asked the little bird, "Where did you come from?" The little bird replied, "I came from the sky, I flew more than a hundred miles, and I was thirsty. I came down to find some water to drink." The frog said, "Friend, don't talk big. , The sky is so big for imports, is it still so far to fly? "The bird said:" You made a mistake. The sky is so big! "The frog smiled and said," Friend, I sit in the well every day, I looked up at the sky as soon as I looked up. I would n’t be mistaken. ”The bird also smiled and said,“ Friend, I ca n’t be mistaken. Unbelief, you can jump out of the wellhead and take a look. ”
