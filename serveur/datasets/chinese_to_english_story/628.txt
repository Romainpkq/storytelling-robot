The rainbow stopped in the evening. I opened the window and looked at the clear sky to the west. "What a beautiful rainbow!" I said loudly. The younger brother heard the sound and came to the window. The long rainbow stretches in the clear sky to the west, and it looks like a bridge. Red, yellow, green, orange, purple, these colors are very bright. I hurried to the outside of the house in a hurry, and flew towards the rainbow as if running past. I want to run under the rainbow and look up. Run, run, but no matter how I run, I can't catch the rainbow. My brother learns what I look like and opens his hands and looks very happy. Rainbow, you are so beautiful! I hurried to the outside of the house in a hurry, and flew towards the rainbow as if running past.
