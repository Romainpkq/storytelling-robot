The beautiful sea and the sea are blue and wide. The beach is yellow and long and soft. The snow-white waves rushed towards the beach, leaving many small shells. The children laughed happily and ran to the beach. They picked up small shells and wore them into beautiful necklaces, which they hung on their chests. The children happily ran around on the beach and gave a series of joyous laughter to the sea. The children laughed happily and ran to the beach.
