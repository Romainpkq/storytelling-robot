There is a crooked creek in front of the clear stream's little rabbit's house. The stream is clear and bright, which can reflect the shadow of the blue sky. But one day, the rabbit suddenly found that the stream in front of his door turned yellow. It was very strange, so he walked along the creek and wanted to see what happened. The rabbit walked along and saw the tall elephant and the fat wild boar. They were panting and exerting their strength to compete for a thick tree by the creek, who wanted to compare their strength . The little rabbit shouted to them as he ran, "Hurry up and stop! You loosen the dirt, the dirt fell into the stream, and we have no clean water to drink!" Elephants and wild boars saw the rabbit His face flushed urgently, and all knew that he was wrong, so he worked together to plant the big tree back. Soon the stream cleared again, reflecting the shadow of the white clouds on the blue sky.
