Mishutka and Stasik sat on the bench in the small garden and chatted. Their chats are different from other children's; they speak big things and falsehoods as if they are the most bizarre than watching who speaks. "How old are you?" Mishutka asked. "Ninety-five. What about you?" "I'm all forty years old." Mishutka said, "You know, I used to be as tall as Uncle Paulia, but it became so short again now "Starcick immediately said," Then I changed from a child to an adult, and then to a child, and I will become an adult later. "" I used to swim across the river. "Mishutka Said again. "Huh, you can swim across the river, and I can swim across the sea." "What's so great about the sea! I can swim across the ocean!" "I used to fly!" "Don't brag, you fly me one "" "Not right now, I have forgotten how to fly."
