The goose "layed an egg" remembered the funny thing that happened when I was eight years old, and I still remember it so far, so I can't help but laugh. In the winter vacation that year, I took the big yellow dog to my uncle's house in the countryside. A big white goose walked and twitched fatly, and I stared at its belly, it seemed to be laying eggs! Let me remind it! The big yellow dog and I started to "action", and the big white goose fled everywhere; the big yellow dog rushed over, and I quickly pressed the big white goose to hold it, letting it bark loudly, and pressed its stomach. Suddenly someone lifted me up from behind. I stood beside my uncle like a captive who had defeated the war. The big yellow dog waiting to be appreciated saw the situation was bad, and ran with its tail in it. "What the hell are you doing?" I hesitated for a moment and finally said it. Uncle said, "How can this goose lay eggs? It's a male goose!" Alas, Bai tossed for a long time, really inspiring!
