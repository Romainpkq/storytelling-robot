The spring bamboo shoot sounded a spring thunder, which awakened the bamboo shoots. They broke through the earth, overturned the stones, and emerged one by one from the ground. The spring bamboo shoots are wrapped in light brown coats, like tender dolls. They face the spring breeze, laugh in the sun and grow in the spring rain. One section, one section, and another section. Up, up, up again. The spring bamboo shoot sounded a spring thunder, which awakened the bamboo shoots.
