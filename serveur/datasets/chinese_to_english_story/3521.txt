What is the New Year? I had a dream. I got on a spaceship and traveled. I asked the stars: "What is the new year?" The stars said in a low voice: "The new year is the new clothes and new hats." The moon said loudly: "The new year is candy and toys." The sun said with a smile: "The new year is happy, the new year is progress "I understand, the new year is coming, and I grew up a year old. I will be more sensible and competent!
