I like rain. The rain in spring germinated the seeds, and a piece of pink willow green on the earth. The rain in summer bathes the earth, and people feel very cool. The rain in autumn put the golden coat on the earth, and the earth was harvested. However, yesterday's rain was terrible, just like someone in the sky poured down pot after pot of water, washed down the road, and washed the crops. Rain brings many benefits to people, and sometimes brings disasters to people.
