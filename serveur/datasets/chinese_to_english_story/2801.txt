In the early winter morning, there was a thick fog. The towers and hills in the distance could not be seen. The fields and woods in the vicinity are separated by a layer of yarn, which is vague and indistinct. The sun is like a red ball, rising slowly, emitting a faint light, not dazzling at all. The crops in the field are all harvested. People are busy harvesting cabbage in the garden. The fog slowly dissipated and the sun shone out. The towers and hills in the distance can be seen. The fields and woods nearby can also be seen clearly. Many persimmons hang on the persimmon trees, like red lanterns one by one. A thick layer of yellow leaves fell in the woods. Only the pine and cypress trees were not afraid of the cold, but still so green.
