Little grass baby 's green clothes In our school, there are two large lawns, and the cute little grass baby lives in it. In the spring, the baby in the grass showed her little head and put on the green clothes sent by the spring girl to add green to the campus. The campus looked even more beautiful. They are holding hands, side by side, dressing up the campus, bringing a lot of laughter to teachers and classmates. In summer, the baby grass grows taller and the clothes are greener. From a distance, it seems that the campus is covered with a green carpet. From a closer look, when Sister Feng blew, the baby grass nodded, as if dancing! In autumn, the little grass baby wants to change clothes, so she wears yellow clothes made by autumn mother-in-law. Suddenly, the autumn wind blew and the yellow dress fell off, and the campus was like gold laid on the ground. In winter, the little grass baby is afraid of coming out of the cold, hiding in the ground to sleep, giving birth to the second year of life in the embrace of the earth. I love you, cute little grass baby, because you are the four seasons of our campus! In autumn, the little grass baby wants to change clothes, so she wears yellow clothes made by autumn mother-in-law.
