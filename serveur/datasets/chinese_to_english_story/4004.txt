A beauty contest is being held in the beauty contest forest. Miss Duck quickly put on a pair of small red leather shoes and ran to "Plop". She fell down. At this moment, the little frog was coated with a layer of white powder, Miss Crow was dressed with colorful peacock feathers, and Miss Cat was wearing a pink dress and took to the stage. Miss Duck took off her shoes and walked freely on the stage with bare feet. In the end, Miss Duck won the first place.
