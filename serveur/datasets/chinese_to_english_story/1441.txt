Rainbow and ancient bridge After the rain, a rainbow appeared in the blue sky. That rainbow is pretty. The old bridge after the rain is not like that. It is simple, silent, and roots the ancient roots on the solid ground, allowing people to come and go freely. Rainbow looked at the ancient bridge and squeezed out a laugh from the gap between the teeth: "Hee hee! You can also call the bridge! Look at my colorful and high-hanging blue sky. Little old man, you deserve to be called a bridge too! "The ancient bridge was silent, still silent, welcoming people from south to north. The rainbow became more proud. However, even he couldn't figure out what was going on. Suddenly, he found that he had gradually disappeared. But the ancient bridge still stood solidly. The rainbow became more proud.
