The grandmother's small mountain village lives in a beautiful small mountain village. Today, we took bus 9 to grandma's house. After getting out of the car, we embarked on a winding mountain path. On both sides of the mountain road were tall and tall trees, and not far away were a piece of tea garden, tea farmers in twos and threes were picking tea, and a large and large green wheat field There are several farmers who are weeding the grass. It is getting closer and closer to grandma 's house. Look, the small mountain village is full of green, green grass, green trees, green wheat fields, green tea leaves, even my breath is full of green. Finally arrived at grandma 's house. Look, there is a wide and big pond in front of my grandmother's house. There are a few ducks swimming freely in the water. On the west of the pond is the willow girl with long braids, and the wicker is blown by the wind Sway gently, as if dancing. Ah, how beautiful the little mountain village of Grandma 's house!
