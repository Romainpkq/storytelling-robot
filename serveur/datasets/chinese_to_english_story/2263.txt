Brave and smart A little squirrel and three little kangaroos play under a fruit tree, and the mother kangaroo looks at them not far away. Suddenly, a bad wolf jumped out of the forest. The kangaroo mother was quick-witted, grabbed two little kangaroos and a little squirrel, stuffed it into the chest pocket, and put on a posture to fight the evil wolf. However, another baby kangaroo failed to return to his mother's pocket in time under a walnut tree that was far away. The evil wolf drooled and swooped past. "Boom!" Something hit the old wolf's head melon, and the evil wolf raised his mouth with his mouth wide open. "Boom!" Another thing stuck in his throat, and the wolf was terrified, thinking it was a hunter's bullet, and quickly escaped with his tail caught. Everyone looked up and it turned out that it was the mother of the squirrel who threw the walnuts on the tree. At this time, the little squirrel and the little kangaroo jumped out of the mother kangaroo 's pocket. The little squirrel said to the little kangaroo: "Your mother is so brave!" The little squirrel said to the little squirrel: "Your mother is so clever!" Hearing this, both the kangaroo mother and the squirrel mother laughed.
