Spring is here, spring is here, spring is full of birds. Butterflies danced, bees buzzed, hibernating frogs stretched out, and swallows from the south came. Summer is here, summer is here, summer is really lively. The grasshopper sang happily, the dragonfly flew high, and the knowledge of the tree called, and the fireflies lit the lamp at night.
