Jellyfish May 1st, my mother took me to the Ocean Aquarium and saw the jellyfish that made me feel new. Jellyfish is a mollusk living in the ocean. Their bodies are transparent, and they look soft and soft, and they seem to break when touched, and they look like blossoming mushrooms from a distance. They are blood red, sea blue, snowflake white ... It looks crystal clear, looks like a parachute floating in the ocean, leisurely swimming in the water, slowly, freely ... adds a mystery to the marine world Colors. I thought: How could there be such a strange creature in the marine world? It is said that jellyfish can produce oxygen and purify the water in the ocean. No wonder people call them "jellyfish".
