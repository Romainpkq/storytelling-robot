Little Monkey makes a call A little monkey has a phone installed in his house. He thinks: It's so convenient to invite friends to be a guest at home now. He picked up the phone on the table and started dialing. Dial the white rabbit's phone number first, and said, "Hey, is it a three-flap mouth?" Little White Rabbit was angry with him. He called Piggy's house again: "Is it a fat piggyball house?" Piggy ignored him. When the monkey mother saw it, she said to the monkey: "It 's too impolite for you to call. You don't know how to respect others. How can others come to be a guest?" Hearing, he lowered his head in shame. He picked up the phone on the desk and started dialing. First dial the phone number of the little white rabbit's family. After being connected, he said, "Hey, is this the family with three flaps?"
