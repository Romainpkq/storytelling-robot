In a green boat in spring, the willow tree bent over and used the pond as a mirror. The spring breeze blew gently, and the willow branches shook. Liu Ye'er is more like a bow, covered with willow branches. In autumn, the willow bent over and looked into the mirror against the pond. The bow was loosened, and each piece fell down like a small boat, spinning gently on the surface of the water, slowly swaying. Turn, turn, the boat sailed. Small boat, small boat, you can come back early, and tie the bow to the top of the willow tree again.
