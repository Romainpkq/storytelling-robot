One day, the two husbands had a cousin eating noodles and a grandpa drinking tea. The little cousin asked, "Grandpa, why is your beard so long? Why am I without a beard?" Dad smiled and said, "You are not old yet!" The little cousin thought for a while, and put some noodles in it On the lips, he said to his grandpa, "Grandpa, look, I am old and have a beard." Grandpa smiled and said to the little cousin, "We have two husbands here." Why do I have no beard?
