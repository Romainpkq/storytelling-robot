There is a little flower cat in my family. It is covered with long hairs, black and white are really beautiful. It has a pair of round eyes, like a glass ball, it will glow green at night. The little cat's ears are very sensitive. As long as there is a little sound, the ears will stand up. It also has a furry tail, and when happy, it swings from side to side, like a flower stick. The little cat's nose has a very sensitive sense of smell, and Lao Yuan has a fishy smell, and it can also smell. There are five small meat pads on its feet. They are soft like quilts. They walk quietly without any sound. My little cat is so cute.
