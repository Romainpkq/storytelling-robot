It flew east to west, and while flying, it was called "Cuckoo, Cuckoo, hurry up Cuckoo!" In the cries of cuckoos, the earth changed into green clothes. Large crops are connected to the orchard, the mountain terraces are like colored sky ladders, and the green grass is covered with golden, pink and pale blue flowers. Bees come to gather honey, butterflies fly to dance. The lively river sang a song and happily flowed into the distance. Seeing spring so beautiful, the cuckoo is very happy. At this time, it was really too tired, so it quietly returned to its own nest and slept. The next day, the cuckoo woke up and found himself wearing a floral skirt. "What 's going on?"
