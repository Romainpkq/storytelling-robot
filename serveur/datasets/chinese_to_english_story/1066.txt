After spending a year, Russian writer Gorky recuperated on an island in Italy. His ten-year-old son followed his mother to visit his father. The son planted some flower seeds in the yard where my father lived. Soon, he returned to China with his mother. In spring the flowers sprout and grow leaves, and soon the flowers are in full bloom. Gorky looked at the blooming flowers under the window, and was very happy, so he wrote a letter to his son, which means: You are gone, but the flowers you planted are left. I looked at them and thought to myself: My good son left something as beautiful on the island as flowers. If you leave people with beautiful things no matter what time and place, like flowers, good thoughts, and very good memories for you, how happy your life is! At that time, you will feel that everyone needs you. You know, "giving" is always better than "getting". After spending a year, Russian writer Gorky recuperated on an island in Italy.
