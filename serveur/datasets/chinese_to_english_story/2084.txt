Uncle Feng one day, Uncle Feng said to the children: "Every one of you will find a child who is a mother of water, but you can't find springs, streams, rivers, rivers, lakes and sea water." The children nodded. Go out together. Big baby came back, holding a dark cloud, second baby came back, surrounded by a rainbow, three baby came back, holding a thick fog, four baby came back, picked a dewdrop, five baby came back, draped Here comes a hoarfrost, Liuwa came back, picked a snowflake, Qiwa came back, carrying an iceberg. Uncle Feng looked at it and said happily, "You are all right. It's really a smart boy."
