The colorful "June 1" festival is today the "June 1" International Children's Day and it is our own festival. In the morning, our school organized a "June 1" celebration. Look, the colorful flags flutter around the school, the students are all energetic, the bright red scarves are particularly dazzling, and the laughter goes straight to the sky. The wonderful program began. See, the trumpeter and the drummer each have their own postures, and each has their own blowing and playing styles. The wonderful programs one after another, the little singers let go of their bright singing voices, and the beautiful songs spread all over the campus. The little girls were dancing in beautiful dresses, the audience watched with relish, and bursts of warm applause burst from time to time. Unconsciously, the show was over, the campus gradually recovered calm, and we left the campus reluctantly.
