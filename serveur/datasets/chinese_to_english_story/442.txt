On the occasion of the Spring Festival, my mother bought a picture. At a glance, there is nothing particularly attractive about this painting. I thought to myself: There are so many colorful New Year pictures in the bookstore. Why should my mother buy this one? As I pondered, I admired it carefully. This is a Chinese painting. The background of the painting is a tall and tall mountain. It is shrouded by a faint cloud of smoke. A vigorous pine tree was planted across the hillside, and under the pine tree were a pair of galloping horses. Running in front is a bay horse, which is fiery red, hoarse, and the red mane floats high. The muscles of the whole body are as strong as athletes on the boxing arena, and they are protruding, piece by piece, very powerful. The bay horse rises into the air, and the soft and beautiful horse tail shakes vigorously. Next to the bay horse is a white horse, white from beginning to end. There wasn't even a hair, like a white cloud drifting lightly, it seemed so free and straightforward, it was clearly a Maxima. The more I look the more I am fascinated, I seem to hear the "hoof" of the horseshoes, and see the waves of dust rolled up behind them, as if I saw them flying freely across the vast field. At this moment, I suddenly remembered the question just now, and ran to ask my mother. My mother smiled mysteriously, and asked me, "What are you?" I realized suddenly, rushing to say, "I know, I know, I am a horse. The horse painted this year symbolizes me. You want me to study hard, not afraid Frustrated, always running forward, right? "Mom nodded with satisfaction. what ! Horse, you know this is my mother â€™s earnest expectation, and I am determined to make it a reality.
