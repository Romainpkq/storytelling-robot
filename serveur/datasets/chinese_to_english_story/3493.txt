In the past, the fox had two pairs of twins, big fat and small fat. They are always arguing all day long. One day, on the way to grandma's house, they found a piece of bread. They were afraid that the other party would eat more, so they kept arguing. A fox came, and it said: "I'll share it, it's absolutely fair." It first divides the bread into one big and one small, and the big fat little fat said: "Not fair." The fox said: "This is not easy to do "The fox took a bite of the big one, and the big one became small. Big fat and little fat still feel unfair, and the fox bites the bigger one again. In this way, the fox bites around, and in the end, the bread is almost completely eaten by the fox. The fox slipped away quietly taking advantage of the stunned effort of the brothers. Only then did the two brothers realize that they were fooled by the cunning fox and regretted it.
