The Penguin King Ice Lion lives in a hot Africa. Summer is here, and the Lion King keeps shouting, "Hot, hot!" Leopard said, "I heard that there is something very cold and cold in Antarctica, called ice." The King Lion said, "Is that right? Then I want to see what ice looks like. "The Lion King immediately wrote a letter to the Antarctic penguin, asking the penguin to send a piece of ice. Many days later, the penguin received a letter. The penguin said, "The King Lion wants a piece of ice? It's too easy. I'm here in snow and ice." The penguin picked up a special piece of ice, put it in a plastic bag, put it in a box, and sent it to the King Lion. The ice box was first boarded on a ship and then on a plane, because there is a long, long road from Antarctica to Africa. After many days, the lion king finally received the parcel. When he opened the box and looked at it, he felt very strange, "Why, how is a bag of water in the box?" The Lion King was very angry. He said to the postman, "Return this parcel!" He also put a piece of paper on the parcel. It said, "I want you to send ice. Why are you sending water?" After many more days, Penguin received the returned box. He quickly opened the box. The plastic bag in the box was still the square ice. "Isn't it clear that it's ice? How did the lion king say it was water?" The penguin was confused. "He also put a note on the parcel that said:" I want you to send ice, why do you send water?
