In the doctor forest of trees, there is a century-old tree, which is lush and leafy, and is a good place for birds to play with. One day, for no reason, the leaves of the old tree slowly turned yellow. The branches began to wither. The little birds were very anxious and hurried to the doctor of woodpeckers. The woodpecker doctor flew over. It stopped on the branch and knocked with his mouth first. Oh ! It turned out that the tree worm was messing up. The woodpecker took out its "scalpel"-its pointed mouth pecked, pecked, and pecked on the old tree, pecked out a small mouth, and then stretched out its mouth to forcefully hook the tree worm out. After a while, all the tree bugs on the old tree were eaten up by the woodpecker. Wow ! Very comfortable. The old tree opened his smile and said, "Thank you, Doctor Woodpecker." The woodpecker said, "No need to thank, this is what I should do." The birds can play on the old tree again.
