Cleaning the table Sunday, after lunch with our family, I said to my dad, "I'll clean the table today." My dad said, "Okay, but don't think it's a simple thing. There are some more to do well. Tips. "I said," Be assured, I will do a good job. "So I packed the bowl and chopsticks in the sink, then picked up a rag to clean the table. I used a lot of effort to wipe it, but I wiped it several times without cleaning it. Instead, I stuck the vegetable crumbs on the table and some rice grains to the table. Dad saw it and said with a smile: "Xiao Fan, you haven't rubbed in the right way. You should rub in one direction. You can't make a circle." Dad said as he demonstrated. I wiped it again according to the method my father said ... After a while, the dirty table was wiped clean by me, and it was as bright as a mirror. I ca nâ€™t think of cleaning the table and learning. It seems that I should do more housework! I used a lot of effort to wipe it, but I wiped it several times without cleaning it. Instead, I stuck the vegetable crumbs on the table and some rice grains to the table.
