Little Turtle Brother and Sister Opening a Store Little Turtle Brother and Sister want to open a small store, what kind of store is good? They asked the elephant. The elephant said: "I am a flower shop, I can spray flowers with a big nose." They asked the hippo. The hippo said, "I open a balloon shop, and I can blow out the biggest balloon with my big mouth!" What? The kangaroo mother told them: "I opened a bookstore and put the newspapers in my big pockets. I could sell them wherever I went." The little turtle brother and sister were sad: "We don't have long noses, big mouths, and big pockets. , What should I do? "Later, the little turtle brother and sister were not sad anymore, they opened a biscuit shop. Let the sun bake its back shell hot, then spread the scones on the back shell. Baked, baked, the biscuits are delicious. The little turtle's biscuits are fragrant and crisp, and there are beautiful patterns on it. Everyone came to buy them.
