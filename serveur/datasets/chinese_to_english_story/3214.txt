On the day of the sturdy stick, my father called the three children to his own and said, "You can fold this stick!" "It's easy!" The three children immediately snapped, Broken the stick. "Then fold this now!" The father tied up the three sticks and gave it to the eldest son. "Let's watch!" The eldest son exhausted his strength, just folding the bundle of sticks. The second son also came to try, and the youngest son also tried, but they never broke. "Children, you see, a stick is very fragile, but if you tie the three together, it will become stronger. That is to say, as long as you work together, there is nothing that cannot be done."
