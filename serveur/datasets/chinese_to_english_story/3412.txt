Hyacinth This is a small flower with a unique style. It looks like a daffodil, but the flowers and stems are purple. I can't figure out why it is called "hyacinth": is it not the wind girl who awakened it before it bloomed little flowers to convey the spring message to people? The roots of hyacinths grow in the water, entwined like bean sprouts; don't look at its roots like a big garlic, but it is the general storehouse of hyacinths to store nutrients! When flowers and leaves need nutrition, the roots are reserved for them. Those new leaves spread out all around. As soon as spring comes, hyacinths have trumpet-like flowers in turn from bottom to top, as if telling people: â€œSpring is here! Spring is here! hyacinth!
