Happy Sunday Today is Sunday. The weather is very warm and my father and I decided to go to the park to play. There are so many people in the park! On the winding path, there are grandfather singing a song, big brother running while listening to music, and a group of happy children are catching butterflies on the green grass! I quickly joined them. Have a great day today! There are so many people in the park!
