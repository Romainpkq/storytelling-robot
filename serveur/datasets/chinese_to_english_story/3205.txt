When the sky was about to get dark, the rooster met an owl, and there was an argument between them. The rooster said: "As soon as the shiny round thing in the sky came out, the weather was much warmer!" The owl said: "Who said? As soon as the shiny round thing came out, I felt cold all over my body!" Said the rooster: "Warm warm!" The owl said loudly, "cold!" They argued for a long time, and there was no result.
