Once upon a time, there were two generals. They went to buy a shield together. The shield man picked up a shield and showed them. The general standing on the left of the shield looked at it and said, "This gold shield is very good!" The general standing on the right said, "You're wrong, this is a silver shield." The two generals argued like this. The shield man said, "This shield is gold on one side and silver on the other. You can only look at one side. How can it be good?" They went to buy the shield together.
