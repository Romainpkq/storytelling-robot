Sound Kingdom I like dreaming. In the dream, the sound fairy took me into the magical sound kingdom. I walked into the first door of the Kingdom of Sound, and heard the sound of flowing water from sister Xiaohe, the gasp of Grandfather Wind "wheezing", the raining sound of the rain brother "tick and tick", and the thunder of "Lei Bang" Snoring ". I feel like I'm in nature. When I stepped into the second door of the Sound Kingdom, I heard the call of the bird "Â∞è", the call of the dog "Wang", the call of the kitten "Meow", and the roar of the lion. I seem to be at the zoo. A sound of car horns led me to the third door. I seemed to be walking on the road. I heard the sound of bicycle "tinkering," the sound of truck "beeping", the police car "beeping". It was dawn, the dream was awake, and the small alarm clock sang a song, urging me to go to school quickly. A sound of car horns led me to the third door. I seemed to be walking on the road. I heard the sound of bicycle "tinkering," the sound of truck "beeping", the police car "beeping".
