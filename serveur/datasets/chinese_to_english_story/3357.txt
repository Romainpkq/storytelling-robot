There is a group of birds in the yard of the little bird's house. Puppies, rabbits and cats want to make a comfortable home for the little birds so that they can live in the yard forever. The little cat made a beautiful bird cage. The bird looked around, twittered, and flew away. The puppy built a beautiful wooden house. The bird looked around, tweeted, and shook his head. The little rabbit planted a tree. The tree sprouted, and the birds chirped, sang and played in the green leaves. Puppies and kittens understand: Trees are the best home for birds.
