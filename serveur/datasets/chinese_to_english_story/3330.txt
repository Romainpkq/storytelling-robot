Two grains of wheat Two grains of wheat-one barley and one wheat were dragged into the hole by ants and stored. "It's over." The barley grain said to the wheat grain. "We were thrown in this dark hole alone, and we lost our hope of life forever." "No", the wheat grain said: "Hope is there. There is air here." , Moisture, if you want to sprout and grow, you're only going to lose sunlight. As long as the ants don't eat us, we can use our last strength, maybe we can arch out of the ground and find the sun. "The barley grain shook his head, crying Say: "Pull it down! It's at least three feet away from the ground. Is it a dream to get out of the ground with your little body?" Because the barley grains cried all day long, his body was moldy. The vigorous wheat grains began to sprout and grow ... One day, the ants went to his warehouse to check the food, and found that the moldy barley grains and the sprouted wheat grains were inedible, so they were thrown out of the hole as garbage and thrown away Too. The barley kernels vanish when they see the wind. The wheat kernels face the sunlight, take root in the soil, and grow into a green wheat seedling. As long as the faith does not die, there will always be opportunities.
