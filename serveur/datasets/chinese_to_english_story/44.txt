Spring is here "Spring is here!" The swallow yelled, reporting the good news to people. Spring is really here and everything looks like I just woke up. The warm spring breeze blew gently, the golden sun bathed the ground, and it shone warmly on people. The field was covered with green clothes, and the river was flowing swiftly ... the spring really came, and everything seemed like just waking up.
