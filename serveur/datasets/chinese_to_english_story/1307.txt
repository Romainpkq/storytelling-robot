Little Zoo The zoo has camels, rabbits, dogs, deer and baby goats. I like the baby goats most. When I came to the zoo, I ran to the lamb pen first and took out the grass that had been prepared in advance. At this moment, a goat came over. It has white fur, smooth and beautiful, a pair of small horns on its head, a pair of round black eyes embedded in its exquisite face, and a pair of white beards under its small mouth. Yelling.
