Bees and butterflies In the morning, the weather was particularly sunny. The little bee said goodbye to her mother and went to the garden to collect honey. The garden is full of flowers and the little bee is so happy that it sings buzzingly while collecting honey. A butterfly flew over and said, "Little bee with eyes, you look so ugly, what are you flying here? Go away!" The little bee listened and came home sadly. The mother saw it and asked, "Child, what's the matter with you?" The little bee said what the butterfly said, and her mother said earnestly: "Child, beauty is not beautiful. The little bee nodded, and happily went to gather honey again. The little bee said what the butterfly said, and her mother said earnestly: "Child, beauty is not beautiful, you can't just look at the appearance, you have to see if you can help others do things!
