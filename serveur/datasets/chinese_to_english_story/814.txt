My family has a little white rabbit and it looks very cute. The fur of the little white rabbit is white and snowy, in the bright sun, it really looks like a pile of glittering snowflakes. A pair of long ears are erected on its head. As long as there is movement, it keeps swinging. What looks the best is his big red eyes, which are like rubies set in white jade. I like the little white rabbit very much and eat it fresh grass every day. I like the little white rabbit very much and eat it fresh grass every day.
