Dreams of Little Trees Little grey rabbits and little squirrels are bouncing in the woods. The small tree was very envious after seeing it, but its roots were stuck in the soil, and it could not run or jump. One day, it had a dream. The little tree has no root and runs and jumps happily. After a while, the little tree was hot, and the sweat from the leaves turned into water vapor and ran into the sky. The little tree was thirsty and wanted to drink water. But he has no root, what should he do? The little tree woke up from her dream. "Oh, okay, my roots are still in the soil!" It happened that it was raining, and the little tree drank the underground water with the roots "coo-coo". How sweet the water is, enough for the little tree. The little tree has no root and runs and jumps happily.
