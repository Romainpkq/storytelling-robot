Spring is here and winter is over, and the breeze quietly brings spring. The soil in the ground was frozen and became loose, stepping on it softly, like stepping on a thick carpet. The wheat seedlings woke up and stretched their tender green leaves. There is not even a thin piece of ice in the stream. Water is flowing slowly. The breeze blew, and the water surface was rippled like fish scales, and a few ducks jumped into the water, swimming happily. On the bank of the river, the willows sprouted, and the soft branches swayed gently in the breeze. A frog emerged from the hole and crawled slowly by the river. spring is coming . It came to the classroom and quietly listened to the pupils reading and singing. It came to the playground and happily played games with the pupils. Spring is here and winter is over, and the breeze quietly brings spring.
