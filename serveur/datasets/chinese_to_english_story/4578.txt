The moon held by the rope, my smart baby, the moon and you are really good: you walk, it walks, you stop, it stops, it is really obedient on it. It's a little white dog that you hold with a rope. It's a little balloon that you hold with a string. When you sleep, you tie it to the pillow. During the night, the moon hangs over your crib.
