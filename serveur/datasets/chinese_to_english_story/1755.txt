A hand of gratitude On Thanksgiving Day, a first-grade teacher asked the classmates to draw something they were grateful for. Most of these children are from poor families, so she expected that most of them would draw a table of hearty Thanksgiving dishes. But when she saw Douglas's work, she was amazed. A hand was drawn on it! Whose hand is this? Classmates in the class are eager to guess: "This must be the hand of God who has given us food," said a child. "It's the farmer's. He fed the turkey with this hand." Another child continued. After a while of guessing, the students returned to their positions and continued to draw. Then the teacher came to Douglas and bent down to ask his hand. "That's your hand, teacher." He answered timidly. Douglas was short and unpleasant, but the teacher would always take his hand when he was out of class. She often shakes her classmates' hands like this, and everyone is accustomed to it, but this is of great significance to Douglas. Maybe the meaning of Thanksgiving is not to accept gifts, but to take the opportunity to thank others for their contributions, no matter how small they are. Then the teacher came to Douglas and bent down to ask his hand.
