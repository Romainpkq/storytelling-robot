The little monkey rescued the little white rabbit One morning, the little white rabbit planted cabbage in the field. Suddenly, a big fox jumped out from behind the tree and pounced on the little white rabbit, who was so scared that he ran away quickly. The little white rabbit fled up the hillside, and the big fox chased closely behind. With a thump, the little white rabbit fell into the pit. The fox was lying on the edge of the pit with open mouth and drooling, trying to eat the little white rabbit. The little monkey saw it, and it immediately hung upside down on the tree, pulling the little white rabbit out of the big pit. The fox wants to eat the little white rabbit but can't eat it. The little white rabbit was saved.
