Thumbs up class Our class has a very nice name called "Thumbs up class". You see, there is a bright red “thumb” lifted on the wall above the blackboard newspaper, and there is a line of English “I am the best one,” which means “I am the first.” It means one next to the blackboard newspaper. Sunflowers' safflower table, green leaves, golden flower plate, and a "Hanako" hide a picture of our class children. Whoever gets the little saffron will happily paste it next to the picture. We It is often better than the one who gets the most saffron. Everyone wants to be the first. The children in the "Thumb Up Class" are all croaking.
