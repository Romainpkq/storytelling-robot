Beautiful little pond There is a park near my house. There is a very beautiful pond in the park. The pond was filled with clear water. The sparkling water waves flickered in the sunlight and the breeze, just like big eyes twinkling. The pond is surrounded by tender green grass, which looks far away. Like the Creator, the ground is covered with a thick green carpet. It is very beautiful. Sometimes when I am playing by the pond, I will also see a group of birds flying happily over the pond. In the evening, the sky was full of red glow, and the glow was reflected on the water surface, as if a layer of red, transparent gauze was spread on the water surface. Night fell, and the crooked moon reflected on the water surface, like a small boat gently rippling in the water waves; and the stars reflected on the water surface, like the shining pearls, kept jumping in the water waves. What a beautiful little pond! The pond is surrounded by tender green grass, which looks far away. Like the Creator, the ground is covered with a thick green carpet. It is very beautiful.
