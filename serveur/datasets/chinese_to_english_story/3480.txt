The little gecko borrowed the tail to climb and climb to the side of the river. He saw the little fish swimming around with its tail wagging in the river. The little gecko said, "Sister Xiaoyu, can you lend your tail to me?" Xiaoyu said, "No, I want to use the tail to draw water." The little gecko said goodbye to the little fish and crawled forward. The little gecko climbed and climbed up to the big tree. He saw the old oxen flick its tail and graze under the tree. The little gecko said, "Uncle Yellow Cow, can you lend your tail to me?" The old yellow cow said, "No, I will use the tail to catch the flies." The little gecko said goodbye to the old yellow cow and crawled forward. The little gecko climbed and climbed under the eaves. He saw the swallows flying with their tails flying in the air. The little gecko said, "Aunt Swallow, can you lend me your tail?" The swallow said, "No, when I fly, I have to use the tail to control the direction." The little gecko was very sad because he couldn't borrow the tail. He crawled and crawled, and crawled back home to find his mother. The little gecko told his mother about borrowing the tail. The mother smiled and said, "Stupid boy, you turn around and look at it." The little gecko turned to look around and cried happily: "I have a new tail!"
