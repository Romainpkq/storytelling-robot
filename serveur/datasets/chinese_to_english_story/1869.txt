At night, the fireflies carrying lanterns covered the moon with clouds. The hot air on the ground is still evaporating, and the weather is still so hot. We all shook our fan into the yard to take a cool ride, but the fireflies were carrying small lanterns and flying on the grass. Is it to give way to the lost ants? Or lighting up the textile girl at night? Or ... fly, fly, fly over the blades of grass, fly under the big trees, the fireflies are not afraid of heat, and take great pains. Photo, photo, the small lantern of the firefly, like the stars in the fairy tale world, twinkles, so charming! We all shook our fan into the yard to take a cool ride, but the fireflies were carrying small lanterns and flying on the grass.
