Small snowflakes I am white and clear small snowflakes, and I float down lightly from the high clouds. I covered the mountains, and the mountains were covered with beautiful white sand. I covered the roof, and the roof was covered with a layer of glittering silver tiles. I'm covered with cypresses and they produce a lot of cotton. I fell bare branches, and the branches were in full bloom. I filled the wheat field, and the wheat field was covered with soft cotton wool. I fell on the ground, and the ground was covered with white carpets, shining with dazzling silver flowers. I am a small white snowflake, I float down from the high clouds.
