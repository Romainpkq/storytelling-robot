Yaya draws a small tree branch and squats on the beach to learn how to draw. Draw a frog, and the waves rushed up and ate it in one bite. Draw a little bird twitter, and the waves rushed up, frightening the bird to fly away. Draw a small shrimp crawling, the waves rushed up, carrying the shrimp, and returned to the sea to find her mother.
