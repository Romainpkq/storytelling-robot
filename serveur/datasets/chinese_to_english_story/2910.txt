There is an old and tall jujube tree in my yard. In spring, jujube trees are covered with pale yellow jujube flowers. In summer, the flowers fall, and the jujube trees are covered with small green dates. In autumn, the little green dates slowly turned red, becoming very big and big dates. At this time, the trees seemed to be covered with small round lanterns. My children and I stood under the tree, looking up at the red dates, so happy! At the end of autumn and early winter, we ate red and sweet jujubes, and we were very grateful to those who planted jujube trees.
