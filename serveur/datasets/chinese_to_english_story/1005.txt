Happy little snail I am a happy little snail. My shell is my house, and I carry it in the green fields every day. There are tender green grasses, sweet dew, and dragonflies and butterflies to accompany me to play. My favorite is rainy day, because the humid environment makes me feel particularly comfortable. After the rain is fine, children often see me when they go out to play. At this time, I may drink dew slowly on the blade of grass, stretch my waist on the ground and breathe the fresh air, or I may stand on the sunflower and enjoy the scenery in the distance ... I like my life very much. Once I climbed to the tree with difficulty, and saw a park not far away, with bright flowers, beautiful rockery, and a group of happy children. The children are playing happily and chasing each other, and there is a continuous stream of laughter. I thought secretly: Although I climb very slowly, I must try hard to climb. If I can play with the children in the park, I will be happier!
