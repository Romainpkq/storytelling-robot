Magpies, crows and golden pheasants. Magpies, crows and golden pheasants originally wore white feather coats. Everyone wanted to dress themselves up. One day, the magpie suddenly had an idea. Various colors and dyes were found in the jungle for everyone to dress up. The crow first drew the magpie. It was dipped in black and carefully painted on the magpie. The eager magpie, at the sight of drawing the black stripes, cried out: "Okay, okay! Okay, okay!" Said to fly away. The golden pheasant came together immediately and said, "It's me! It's me!" The crow painted the golden pheasant with one stroke at a time, using the seven colors found by the magpie, and worked very carefully from beginning to end. After painting for a long time, the crow said, "Okay, go to the stream and look in the mirror." Jinji looked at the stream: "Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!" So beautiful, it said to the crow gratefully, "I ca n’t see it. Your hand is so clever. What a clever artist!" Next, it ’s Caragana's turn to paint the crow. It picks up a black-colored pot. As soon as I was about to paint, my heart whispered, "I want you to paint like that, when do you want to paint it!" Suddenly it had an idea, shaking a pot of black dye onto the crow, and then said, "Okay. OK! "" So fast? "The crow turned around to take a look, and the golden pheasant flew away. When he went to the stream and looked at it, he exclaimed angrily: "Ahh! Ahhhhhhhhhh!" The crow painted the golden pheasant one by one with the seven colors found by the magpie. At the end, I painted very carefully.
