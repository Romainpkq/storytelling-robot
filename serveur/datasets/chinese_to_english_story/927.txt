Light raindrops, two drops from the sky, and from the roof. Light rain, light rain, please jump to my mouth, drop by drop, cool, sweet. No wonder the seeds germinate when they are drunk, and the flowers are more beautiful when they are drunk. Light raindrops, two drops from the sky, and from the roof.
