Martha was a guest in the woods. Martha saw a husband sitting on the ice bench, eating snow dumplings. "Hello, little girl!" Her husband nodded, and the snow flakes fell, "I'm Snow White, welcome you to be a guest." Martha came to Snow White's house-the house made of ice, the wall embedded with snowflakes, The bed was covered with snow mattresses, so beautiful. Martha touched the thick snow mattress: "How soft!" Father Snow Snow said: "I still have wonderful things here!" Martha asked in surprise: "Why is it pressed down below?" Father Snow Xue laughed: "I covered the wheat seedlings with snow mattresses to protect them from overwintering! The pests in the ground hit me and couldn't stand the cold, they froze to death "Oh, that's what it is. Martha immediately covered the snow mattress gently. She seemed to see the spring, the wheat was heading and flowering.
