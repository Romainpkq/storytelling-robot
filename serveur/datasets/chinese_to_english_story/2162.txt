In the vegetable garden, the more I look, the more melons lie on the ground, and the eggplants hang on the branches. Under the eaves, the mother swallow asked the little swallow: "Can you fly to the vegetable garden and see what is the difference between winter melon and eggplant?" The little swallow flew away and came back: "Mom, mom, the winter melon is big, eggplant It ’s small! ”Said Mother Swallow:“ Good. But, can you go and see, what ’s the difference? ”Little Swallow flew away, and came back:“ Mum, Mom, the winter melon is green, eggplant It's purple! "Mother Swallow nodded and said," Very good. But, can you go take a closer look, what's the difference between them? "Little Swallow flew again and cried happily when he came back "Mom, mom, I found that the melon skin has fine hairs and there are small thorns on the stems of the eggplants!" Mom Swallow smiled happily: "This child has improved from time to time."
