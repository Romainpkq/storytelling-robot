The lively sika deer with long eyes ran in the woods, and a few vine leaves hung on its horns, and it didn't know it either. Beside the grove was a small pond, and a little deer looked at it, and a small tree reflected in the pond, with green leaves floating on the small branches. Look again, there are a pair of bright eyes blinking under the small branch! Fawn smiled happily: "Isn't that me? I have become a little tree, and still have leaves!" Just then, three beautiful little birds fell on the pair of branches. They jumped up and down and sang nice songs. The deer loves to move around, but now he is holding his breath and doesn't move, because he knows that the little bird is very timid. The little deer saw from the calm waters that the three little birds were so happy that they had endless songs. Fawn said quietly in his heart: "Sing it, sing it, I'm a happy little tree, and welcome the birds to sing ..." Fawn loves to move around, but now he is holding his breath, every move also Does not move, because it knows that the little bird is very timid.
