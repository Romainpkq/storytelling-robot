In the green boat in spring, the willows bend down and look at the pond as a mirror. The spring breeze blew gently, and the willow branches shook and shook. Willow leaves are more like bows, full of willow branches. In autumn, the willow bends down and looks into the pond against the pond. The bow was loosened, and the pieces fell down, like a small boat, swirling gently on the water surface, slowly waving. Go, go, the boat sails away. Small boats, small boats, come back early, and re-tie the bows with willow treetops.
