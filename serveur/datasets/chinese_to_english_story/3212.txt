In the winter morning, two little rabbits were playing on the hillside. Suddenly, an eagle flew, and the little white rabbit shouted, "Hurry up! The little grey rabbit said," Where is there a hole? "The little white rabbit said," Hurry up and hide in the rock pile! After talking, the little white rabbit ran into the snow under the mountain. The eagle flew, went around in the sky a few times, and found nothing, and flew away.
