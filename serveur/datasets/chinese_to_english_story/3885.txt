In the past, a teacher taught a question to students: see who can buy a thing with not much money and can fill up the study. After school, all the students went to the fair. Some bought straw, some bought saplings, some bought cotton ... but no one could fill the study room with anything. A student named Han Yu walked into the study, took a candle from his sleeve, and lit it. The candlelight immediately lit up the whole room. Mr. met, and said happily, "Okay! Okay! Han Yu is really smart!"
