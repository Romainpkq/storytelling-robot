The little monster who read the wrong spell The little monster learned a lot of spells from his father. He used spells to transform gardens, castles, gold and silver jewelry. Although the little monster can make many things out of spells, he is not happy at all, and there is no smile on his face. One day, somehow, he pronounced the wrong spell and turned himself into a little lame man. The little monster was limping and walking in the forest. The little rabbit saw it and jumped all the way to help him lift the things in his hand. The little monkey saw it and helped him down the high hill. The little lark saw it and brought him many delicious fruits. When the little monster said "Thank you" to the rabbit, monkey, and lark, they all smiled sweetly on their faces. The little monster realized at this time that happiness was not hidden in his spell, but in the joy of helping others and receiving the help of others.
