The seven-year-old poet Luo Binwang was a famous poet in the Tang Dynasty. He can write poetry at the age of seven. One day, King Luo Bin played by the pond and saw two snow-white geese swimming around on the turquoise water. The little white goose also stretched out his neck and cried with joy. King Luo Bin was so fascinated that he wrote a poem: Goose Goose, Song Xiangtiange. White hair floats in green water, and Anthurium clears waves. The poem written by the seven-year-old poet has been circulating to the present.
