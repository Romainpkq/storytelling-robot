Changeable foxes A long time ago, there were two students in the "forest school": the hare and the fox. The hare is studying very carefully, it always answers the questions raised by the teacher accurately. The fox is a bit poorer in learning, so when he sees the hare, he greets him kindly and asks a good question. The hare always responds with courtesy. A few days later, due to illness, the hare 's academic performance dropped and he fell behind the fox. When he was well, he carried his schoolbag to school. On the way, he encountered a fox. "Classmate fox, how are you!" The hare greeted the fox first. The fox didn't seem to hear it, and still went forward. "What's wrong, don't you know me, fox?" The hare followed, and said, "I'm your classmate hare!" "A wild rabbit who knows where you are, dare to call me a classmate, hum , Walk away! "The fox replied dismissively. Hare felt very aggrieved. He came to school silently and began to study hard. After a few more days, the hare scores again topped the list. After school that day, the hare met the fox again. "Ah, hare, how are you, I am your good classmate, fox." The fox stood aside respectfully and said affectionately. However, the hare walked away, and it was no longer willing to make friends with the changeable fox. The hare is studying very carefully, it always answers the questions raised by the teacher accurately.
