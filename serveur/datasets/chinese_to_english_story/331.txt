During the physical education class, Teacher He led us to play games. The whole class stood in a circle, listening to the sound of the teacher's whistle, and strode around the circle together. Suddenly, Teacher He shouted, "Three people in a group." The students immediately held hands with three people. The whistle sounded again, the group disbanded, and the classmates continued to walk in circles. At this time, the teacher said aloud again: "Five people in a group." The students then held hands in groups of five. When I saw Xiaocheng rushing to my group, I immediately said, "We have five people. Go and find another group." He rushed to the other group, and the classmate said that there were enough. Xiaocheng runs around, I don't know where I should go. At this time, a scream of "Come here! Come here!" Came in the distance. Xiaocheng ran quickly and held hands with the group of students. The whistle sounded again, the group disbanded, and the classmates continued to walk in circles.
