When Nang Ying was studying in the Jin Dynasty, Che Yin was tireless in learning, but his family was poor and his father could not provide him with good learning conditions. Without money to buy oil lamps, he can only recite poems at night. One night, he was reading articles in the yard. Suddenly he saw many fireflies flying at low altitude, and he had an idea. So he grabbed dozens of fireflies and put them in a pocket sewed with white silk and used it to illuminate, so he could barely read a book. The story of "Capsule Reading" is passed on to future generations as a story.
