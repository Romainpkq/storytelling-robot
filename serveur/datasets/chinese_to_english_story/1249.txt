The pomegranate flower is spring, and the pomegranate flower is in bloom. Its flowers are orange-red, the stamens are yellow, and there are some thin petals on the head, and from time to time they emit a burst of fragrance. At the end of summer, some pomegranate flowers had larger and larger belly, and soon they were as big as eggs. After a few weeks passed, the petals of the pomegranate flower gradually fell, and the pomegranates opened their mouths and laughed, how tidy the rows of red "teeth" were. Here comes the autumn. The pomegranate is ripe. Pick it down and taste it. Hey! It is sour and sweet, so delicious. In winter, when the northwest wind blows, the leaves on the tree fall down. The pomegranate flower is spring, and the pomegranate flower is in bloom.
