Give me this big apple. "The kitten said," When the fruit is buggy, I sprayed the potion and killed all the bugs. Give me this big apple. "What should I do? The little bear's eyes turned, and the apple was cut into six pieces. He picked the two largest pieces and gave them to his father and mother. Oh ! The little friends understand: You must first think of your elders when eating, and sharing happiness is the happiest one. The little bear's eyes turned, and the apple was cut into six pieces.
