Another little squirrel stepped forward and took five comparisons. Small grapes, he said: "I eat small grapes, my mother will be able to eat big grapes!" Another little squirrel stepped forward to take five grapes that were a little broken, he said: "I have crushed grapes Mom will be able to eat good grapes!
