The wind on the sea is the god of flowers. When she picks it up, she opens up thousands of waves ... the wind on the sea is a luthier, and when she comes, she sings thousands of songs ... the wind on the sea is a strong man. Just send away tens of thousands of fishing sails ... the wind on the sea is a lion, and when it roars, it sets off a violent wave ... the wind on the sea is a luthier, and when she comes, she will play a million songs ...
