My bed is a small boat. My bed is like a small boat. The babysitter helps me step into the cabin. She put me on sailor's clothes and sent me to sail in the dark. I stood at the bow of the boat, saying goodbye to all my friends on the shore. I closed my eyes and sailed, and I no longer heard or saw anything. Sometimes, I put things on the bed, like the thoughtful sailor, take a whole piece of wedding cake, or take a few toys together. All night, we sailed at the helm, and finally, the boat drove into the daytime. I found that my boat was close to the pier and returned to my room safely.
