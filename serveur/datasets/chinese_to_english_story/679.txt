Giant pandas There are many rare animals in our country. The most lovely ones are the giant pandas. The panda's body is chubby, its tail is short, its fur is smooth, its head and body are white, and its limbs are black. It has a pair of furry black ears on its head and two round dark circles. When the panda was small, he was very lively and liked to climb up and down. When I grow up, I do nâ€™t like much activity, I often hold my head in my paws, and sleep loudly. Go tease it, it will open its eyes and look at it, and then sleep again. Sometimes it also swings its chubby body and walks around looking for food to eat. Giant pandas like to eat fresh bamboo leaves and bamboo shoots. You see, it hugs bamboo and eats deliciously. Giant pandas There are many rare animals in our country.
