Spring rain and spring rain rustle, and spring rain and sand rustle, as thin as a cow's hair, fluttering. Floating in fruit forests, dotted with red peach blossoms, sprinkled on treetops, dyed with green willow buds, landed in fields, moistened crops, landed in ponds, and awakened frogs. Wet my brim and wet his gown. Under the drizzle, we planted pits and planted trees to green the motherland. Spring rain rustles, spring rain rustles.
