Spring Rain The rusty spring rain, like thousands of silk threads down ... Shuttle swallows hold the rain silk, weaving a beautiful picture of spring. The green ones are willow leaves and the red ones are peach blossoms. A bright stream was also woven, and the fish in the river waggled their tails happily. On the hillside across the river, there are farmers who sow seeds; there are dolls planting trees ... Ah! What a beautiful picture!
