One seed and one seed sleep in the soil. When he woke up, he felt very warm, and he straightened himself up. It was a little thirsty, took a sip of water, felt very comfortable, and lifted his body a bit. The spring breeze blew gently. The seed asked the earthworm: "What sound is outside?" The earthworm said: "That's the spring breeze. The spring breeze is telling us to go outside." "Is the outside so dark?" "No, the outside is very bright." The earthworm said, While drilling out, "I'll help you loosen the soil, so you can drill out." The seed was very happy when listening to it, and propped herself up again. The spring breeze is singing, the spring is singing, the birds are singing, and the children are singing. Hearing the excitement outside, Seed quickly said, "Ah, I'm going out quickly!" Seed propped himself up again, and his eyes lit up suddenly, ah, a bright world!
