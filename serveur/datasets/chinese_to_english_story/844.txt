The little stream sang again.The little stream lived at the foot of the mountain. The green mountains surrounded her, and the gurgling springs fed her. The clear streams reflect the red flowers and green grass around them, and the blue sky and white clouds overhead. The drizzle fell gently, and the stream sang happily: "Brother drizzle, thank you for sending me a new partner. Now, I want to sing more beautifully!" The stream continued on and on. People who walked by the stream praised her: "How beautiful and beautiful the river is, and the singing is so beautiful." The small stream was very proud of the praise. She stopped beside a large bluestone and thought, "My water is so clear and so beautiful, why run again? Let's rest!" The stream stopped and didn't sing. Gradually, she became cloudy. The drizzle advised her: "Small stream, keep going! Only by going forward can you be clear forever." After listening to the drizzle, the stream passed around the big bluestone and sang again. The stream became clear again. Red flowers, green grass, blue sky, and white clouds are reflected in the stream again. The stream became clear again.
