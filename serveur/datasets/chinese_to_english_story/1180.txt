Jellyfish May Day, my mother took me to the marine aquarium and saw the jellyfish that made me feel novel. Jellyfish is a mollusc that lives in the ocean. Their bodies are transparent, they look soft and soft, they seem to break at the touch, and they look like blossoming "mushrooms" from a distance. They have blood red, sea blue, snowflake white ... They look crystal clear, they look like parachutes floating in the ocean, swimming leisurely in the water, slowly and freely ... Adding a mystery to the ocean world Colors. I thought: How could there be such a strange creature in the marine world? It is said that jellyfish can make oxygen and purify the water in the ocean. No wonder people call them "jellyfish". Jellyfish is a mollusc that lives in the ocean.
