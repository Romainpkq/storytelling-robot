Mi Jia 's Diary In winter, Mi Jia slid down the hillside on a sleigh, and skated with her partners on the river. He happily wrote down his diary: "Winter is really interesting. I hope it will always be winter." Spring is here. Mijia looks at the flowers on the green grass and chases the butterflies. He wrote his diary happily: "Spring is beautiful, I hope it will always be spring." When summer comes, Mi Jia catches small fish, picks wild fruits, and turns around in the shade. He wrote his diary happily: "Summer is so happy, I hope it will always be summer." In autumn, the apples in the orchard are red and bright, and the pears are Huang Chengcheng. Mi Jia wrote a diary with satisfaction: "Autumn is so lovely, I hope it will always be autumn." He happily wrote a diary: "Summer is really happy, I hope it will always be summer.
