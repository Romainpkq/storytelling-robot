Watching animals and understanding the weather and weather changes directly affects the lives of animals. Some small animals can feel the weather change and make preparations in advance. The ants moved and the heavy rain blew. Before the heavy rain, due to the increased humidity in the air, the amount of moisture absorbed by the soil increased a lot, so the ant nests built in the soil became damp. In order to avoid flooding, ants often move before heavy rain. The bees came out of the nest and the weather was fine. After a long rain, the air pressure began to rise, the humidity in the air gradually decreased, pollen appeared in the stamen of the plant, and bees went out to collect nectar.
