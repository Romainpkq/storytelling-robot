After the rainbow and the ancient bridge rain, a rainbow appeared in the blue sky. That rainbow is pretty. The ancient bridge after the rain is not like that. It is simple, quiet, and it puts the ancient roots on the solid ground, allowing people to come and go freely. Rainbow looked at the ancient bridge and squeezed a smile out of his teeth: "Hee hee! You can also call the bridge! Look at my colorful sky high in the blue sky, how fashionable, how majestic! But you, your waist is bent like a hump Old man, you deserve to be called a bridge too! "The ancient bridge was silent, still silent, welcoming people from south to north. The rainbow has become more proud. However, even it couldn't figure out what was going on. Suddenly, he found himself disappearing gradually. But the ancient bridge is still standing firm.
