A few days ago, my mother gave me and my sister a big pomegranate. Pomegranate is not good-looking. It does not have the rosy and smooth appearance of apples, which makes people look envious. It does not have the enticing aroma of pineapples. It had only a rough layer of yellow skin, rustic in the soil, and a crack on top of it, like a smirk grinning. I can't figure out why there is a crack here. My mother told me that it was the place where the pomegranate bloomed. I opened the yellow skin of the pomegranate: ah! It is full of very beautiful seeds like crystal beads. They are squeezed tightly and full, and they look really good. The seeds are eaten in the mouth, sweet and sour, really tasteful! My sister and I like eating very much. My mother said to us: "Don't you only see its seeds that look good and delicious, you can't see the rustic peel in the soil, hi, it's still a traditional Chinese medicine for diarrhea!" Eating pomegranate, listening to mother's words, I Understand: Nothing can only look at its appearance. Although pomegranate is not beautiful in appearance, it is useful from the inside to the inside.
