There is a little magpie in my family. It spent three springs and autumns with me and formed a profound friendship with me. The magpie is a kind of auspicious bird, its shape is very beautiful, brownish yellow pointed mouth, pink tongue, eyes flicker like two stars. The feathers on the head and body are blue and black. The black hair on the wings carries a few long feathers. The feathers on the belly are white. The beautiful long tail always tilts upwards.
