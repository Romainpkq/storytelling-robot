There are many, many useful small animals around us, such as dragonflies, little swallows, and frogs. Let's take a look at the dragonfly first! Look, a dragonfly is resting on a branch! The dragonfly has big eyes on its head, which is really like a searchlight. It also has a pair of transparent wings. Its figure is thin and long and really slim. Not only does it eat pests, but it is also a weather forecaster. When it flies low, it shows that the weather has changed. Go and see the little swallows again! Look, there is a little swallow in the sky that is busy catching flying insects! The swallow is dressed in a black tuxedo. The tail is like a pair of small scissors. It is also a weather forecaster. The weather will change when it flies low. Quack quack quack quack quack, who is coming Oh, it turned out to be a little frog. It bulged with a pair of big eyes, dressed in turquoise and green clothes, and exposed the belly of snow-white snow-white, very cute. It can eat thousands of pests in a year. It is a good helper to protect crops. There are so many useful little animals around us! We must protect those lovely little lives well!
