My little solar system There is a little solar system in my house. Of course, the little sun is mine! Everyone revolves around me. Venus ’father was very strict with my study and did not miss a typo; Ms. Mercury cared about me in life, and the weather suddenly became colder. She sent her clothes to school to wear for me; Grandpa Earth is my most respected and feared People, but he can often tell me stories; Grandma Mars loves me most and loves me, she is also my teacher of enlightenment; Grandpa Jupiter picks me up to school in time every day; Grandma Saturn cooks my favorite dishes; Uncle Uranus, Aunt Neptune often buys me food and fun things; the lovely little sister Pluto — well, my happy little friend. How happy and happy I live in this solar system!
