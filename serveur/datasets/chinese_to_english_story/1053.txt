Story of Madam Curie as a Child More than 100 years ago, there was a little girl named Maria in Poland who studied very intently. No matter how noisy she is, she can't distract her. Once, Maria was doing her homework. Her sister and classmates were singing, dancing, and playing games in front of her. As if she hadn't seen it, she was reading a book intently. My sister and classmate want to test her. They quietly put up a few stools behind Maria. As soon as Maria moved, the stool would fall down. Time passed minute by minute, Maria finished reading a book and the stool was still standing there. Since then, my sister and classmates have never teased her anymore, and have been studying and studying hard like Maria. When Maria grew up, she became a great scientist. She is Madam Curie. They quietly put up a few stools behind Maria. As soon as Maria moved, the stool would fall down.
