It's raining It's raining, it's overcast, the clouds are low, and the sun is hiding. The swallows swept over the treetops, the fish jumped out of the water, and the ants whispered, and whispered, "It's going to rain, it's going to rain! Move quickly! Move quickly!" After a while, ticking, ticking ... The raindrops fell !! It fell on the ground like a snare drum; it fell into the pond and made the water laugh with blossoming flowers. Looking up at the sky, the raindrops are connected into silver lines, which are crooked by the wind, like drunken wine, and like dancing. After a while, wow, wow ... the raindrops gathered together and turned into streams, flowing on the ground. She washed the stone steps, washed the playground, and the various asphalt roads became slippery and shiny. We are not afraid of the rain, bare heads, bare feet, running after Yuhua. Some carry sandals in their hands, some wear raincoats, and some wave sticks, like a group of ducks ... in the rain, we go to school. Looking up at the sky, the raindrops are connected into silver lines, which are crooked by the wind, like drunken wine, and like dancing.
