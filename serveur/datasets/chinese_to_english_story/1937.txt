Little Pigs Go to School Early in the morning, the father-in-law slowly climbed to the top of the mountain and shone the warm sunshine into the little pigs' rooms. For the first time, Robbie, Robin, and Roll did not wake up from their mothers, so they got up obediently. They put on clothes, fold their quilts, and wash their little faces clean. Because, today is a special day-Robbie, Robin, Rock, and Roll are going to school! Alas, why is Rock still not up to bed? Look at him, hiding in the quilt with his buttocks, no matter what the sun father Scratching his little feet, he refused to get up. Does Rock want to go to school? Father Pig is here. It pats Rock's head, and asks, "Rock, why don't you get up?" Rock lifted the quilt, revealing his tiny black eyes, and said pitifully: "Dad, I don't want to go to school. Jerry's cousin said that going to school is not fun at all. He can't play games or toys. He is not allowed to talk or disturb during class ... This is terrible. I don't want to go to school." Robbie scratched his head and wondered, "But cousin Jerry also said that he can make many new friends at school, and can also learn to sing, write, and calculate ..." Father Pig said with a smile: " Rock, haven't you always dreamed of being an astronaut? No knowledge is not enough! Love to learn is a good boy who can be praised by others to realize your dream! "Rock crooked his head, thinking about it, Think about it right ... whispered, "I want to go to school." Dad and its four baby pig. See how happy they are, singing while walking: "Do la la, do la la la la la ..." "Rock lifted the quilt and exposed his tiny black eyes, and said poorly," Dad, I don't want to go to school.
