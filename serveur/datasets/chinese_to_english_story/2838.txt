The cradle of the caterpillar is leaves, and the love nest of butterflies is petals. The singing birds have a comfortable nest, hard-working bees, live in beautiful big dormitory, in the clear river, swim fish and shrimp, the green big field is the home of dragonflies. The poor wind has no home, so it runs around and can't find a place to rest. The drifting cloud is also homeless, and as soon as the sky is overcast, it shed tears anxiously. We are the happiest! As soon as we were born, Mom and Dad were ready to go home, let us grow up safely at home.
