Fish, I am a fish, do you know my age? I eat much in spring and summer and grow fast; the opposite is true in autumn and winter. I eat less, grow slowly, and grow at different speeds, and my scales will appear one by one. Just count the lines on my body, You will know how old I am. The opposite is true in autumn and winter. I eat less, grow slowly, and grow at different rates. There will be lines on my scales. As long as I count the lines on my body, you can know how old I am.
