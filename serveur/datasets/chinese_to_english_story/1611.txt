The bathing grass of the flowers was thyme, bedding, wild chrysanthemum and dandelion. One day it rained. The light rain hit the trees in the wild, and a sound came out on the dense leaves, like a rattle in our school: Ding Dong! Doraemon! So a group of small wild flowers came out, and thyme, wild chrysanthemum, ground flooring, and dandelions came out when they heard the sound of the rain. As if they were singing in a kindergarten, they lined up in a small group, went out of the woods, to the grass, and stood in the rain, where they would bathe. Light rain dripped for them, and they sang softly in their mouths. Sometimes I shake my body and let the water drops. Light rain dripped for them, and they sang softly in their mouths. They swayed and washed their hair and body with green bath towels ... Then, the rain stopped. Their bathing also stopped. At this time, the sun was shining on the grass, and there was a light on the grass. How beautiful those little wild flowers look! They scented after bathing. At this time, the sun was shining on the grass, and there was a light on the grass.
