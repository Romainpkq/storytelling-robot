The little monkey ate watermelon. The little monkey ran into the watermelon field. The first time he saw the watermelon, he felt very interesting. He would eat it when he picked the next watermelon. When a calf next to him saw him bring round watermelon to his mouth, he said to him: "You probably won't eat watermelon? I'll teach you ..." The monkey interrupted the calf impatiently and said: "No need to teach you! No need to teach you!" He said that he bit off a piece of watermelon peel, chewed and tasteless, and angrily threw the bitten watermelon on the ground and said: "Not tasty! Not tasty!" Maverick Tell him: "Who told you to eat the skin? Eat watermelon, you should eat the stuffing inside!"
