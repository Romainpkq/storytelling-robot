Autumn dolls write letters Autumn dolls, kindhearted, picking leaves to write letters busy. To whom, to the wild goose, set off for the south. To whom, to the squirrel, prepare winter food quickly. Write to whom, and give the badger a quick hole to build a new house. Write to whom, give you me, wear more clothes and don't catch cold. Write here, write there, the yellow leaves and red leaves are all written.
