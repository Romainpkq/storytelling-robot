Happy Sunday Today is Sunday, the weather is very warm, my father and I decided to go to the park to play. There are so many people in the park! On the curvy path, there are grandpas singing tunes, big brothers running while listening to music, and a group of happy children on the green grass are catching butterflies! I quickly joined them. Have fun playing today!
