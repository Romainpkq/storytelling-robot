Wash my dad Last night, my dad was going to wash his hair. I had a whimsy and was tempted to wash him. I sprinkled hot water on Dad's hair first, then squeezed in shampoo, and rubbed it gently on Dad's head. Although I was careful, my father 's face was covered with water and bubbles. It usually feels so easy to wash my hair, but I didn't expect it to be really easy. My father seemed to see through my mind and encouraged me to say, "It doesn't matter. This is the first time you wash your hair. It doesn't matter if you don't wash well." After hearing what he said, I was not as nervous as I was. The flushing has also gone smoothly. After washing, I asked my father if he was okay. He happily said, "It's great, my daughter has grown up!" I didn't expect that I only did one little thing to make my father so happy. I sprinkled hot water on Dad's hair first, then squeezed in shampoo, and rubbed it gently on Dad's head.
