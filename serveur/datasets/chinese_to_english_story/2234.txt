Ginkgo trees in autumn When autumn arrives, we saw a tall ginkgo tree as soon as we entered the park. The tree is covered with golden yellow fan-shaped leaves, and regular leaf veins are arranged on the leaves. A gust of autumn wind blew, and the ginkgo leaves swayed from side to side, like many golden fans fanning, sending a cool breeze.
