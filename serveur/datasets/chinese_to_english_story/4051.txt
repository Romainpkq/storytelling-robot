Watching the car in the wind and rain In the wind and rain, the three old men are squeezed in an umbrella and their faces pale. Even though they were sitting under the eaves, the rain kept hitting their faces and bodies. At this time their clothes were soaked. However, they did not care about themselves. Three pairs of eyes were staring at the square in front of them, where two bicycles were parked, covered with their only raincoats. The owner of the car has not yet come to pick it up. "Maybe it was trapped by the rain?" They said, but no one wanted to go first. The cold wind blew in bursts and the rain came again and again, but none of them got up, and their three pairs of eyes were still on the two bicycles not far away. Are they just for the parking fees of those few cents?
