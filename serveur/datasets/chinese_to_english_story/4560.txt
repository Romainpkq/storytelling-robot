Little Porcelain Pig "Housekeeper" I have a little Pork piggy bank. Its whole body is white and flawless, chubby. The small mouth pouted upwards, almost connected with the nose, and there was a little red dot on the nose, which looked cute and cute. A pair of eyes looked at me with a smile. There is also a "secret door" on the back of the little porcelain pig. I always put the saved money in its belly. It is my most faithful "little housekeeper".
