Doudou's bad habit Doudou always likes to lick things. He said he wants to taste the taste of things. His mother told him that it was unhygienic and he didn't listen. He often grabbed toys and licked them. He often said, "People said, don't do it clean, and they didn't get sick when they ate." Mother couldn't do anything about him. The bacteria on the plastic elephant was licked into the stomach by Doudou. My stomach hurts! Doudou was rolling with pain. When she saw it, she hurried him to the hospital. The doctor said, "Little Doudou, you will get sick if you lick things up. Now you have to get an injection and medicine!" Little Doudou nodded silently. Since then, Doudou can no longer lick toys. Not only does he not lick things up, he also develops a good habit of washing his hands and changing his clothes frequently. Now that everyone has met Doudou, they all boast that he is a good child who loves cleanliness. His mother told him that it was unhygienic and he didn't listen. He often grabbed toys and licked them.
