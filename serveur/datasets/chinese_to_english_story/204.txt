One night fishing for ducks, I came to the lake and saw a large group of wild ducks in the lake. Unfortunately, I had no bullets. Suddenly, I remembered that in my shoulder bag for hunting, there was a little piece of lard left. Great! Immediately I took out the lard and quickly tied it to a long and thin rope and threw the rope into the water. When the wild duck saw lard, it immediately came over. A pouting wild duck swallowed lard. Because lard is slippery, after it entered the duck's mouth, it quickly passed the duck's intestine and slipped out of the duck's ass! In this way, the wild ducks were put on my rope. At this time, the wild ducks came over, one by one swallowed the lard, and they were worn on my rope one by one. In less than 10 minutes, all the wild ducks looked like beads. Dressed up. I dragged the wild ducks home, and after only a few steps, I was so tired. Suddenly, the wild ducks flew up and took me into the sky. I didn't hesitate to make a rudder out of my coat and directed the ducks to fly to my home.
