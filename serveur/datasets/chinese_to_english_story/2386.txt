Wu Han borrowed a book from the famous historian Wu Han. When he was a boy, he often walked dozens of miles to the county book collector to read books. Sometimes when he borrowed a book, he read while walking, halfway through. When the book was finished, he returned the same way, and returned the book to borrow another one. Once, Wu Han borrowed a copy of "Liao Zhai Zhi Yi" and said that after three months of reading, who knows to return the book on the fifth day. The bibliophile was dubious. He selected several stories in the book for him to tell. Wu Han told them accurately. The bibliographer nodded again and again.
