The precious friendship rooster lives with the elder sister rabbit, the younger duck sister, and the younger squirrel brother. One morning, Sister Rabbit came to her rooster brother: "I'm going to buy radishes and lend me a basket." The rooster said, "I will use it myself, don't borrow it!" At noon, the duck sister came to rooster brother: "You help me Untie the bow! "The cock said," I'm going to eat, I'm not free! "At night, the squirrel brother came to find the cock brother:" I'll go up the hill tomorrow morning to chop firewood, please call me! "The cock said," I'm weak Don't call! "Late at night, the wind lifted the roof of the cock's house, and the cock screamed and jumped. Rabbits, ducks, and squirrels came to help the roosters repair the roof. It was fixed in a while, and the cock blushed. With the help of small animals, the rooster repaired the roof that was lifted off by the strong wind. It can be seen how precious friendship is! Let us all learn to care for others and be a good child who helps others! Rabbits, ducks, and squirrels came to help the roosters repair the roof.
