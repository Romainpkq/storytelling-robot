The door that could not be opened Once upon a time, a little prince lived in a very large palace. The palace has many doors and many windows. There was a small door with a handle on it. The little prince couldn't pull it open. The servants came to the tall sentry who was on guard, and they could not pull them together. The sentinel had the captain. The captain had the most strength. They pulled together, but they still couldn't pull. The captain blew his whistle, and many soldiers ran. They pulled together. As a result, the door handle was broken. No one can open this door. Only the smartest person is invited to ask him how to open this door. The wise old man studied the door for a long time and finally said that it was a door that could not be opened. A maid's child came and asked what was happening here. Others told him that the door wouldn't open. The child said, "How could it? I opened it yesterday." He walked to the door, only lightly. With a slight push, the door opened. "He came to the door and pushed it just a little, and the door opened.
