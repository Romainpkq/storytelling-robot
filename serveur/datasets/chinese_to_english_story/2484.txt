How can I forget the summer of my childhood as a vegetable garden? The vegetable garden next to the lotus pond in the countryside-the green cucumber rack is covered with golden flowers, and the white flowers in the black oily potato field are dazzling; The small flower hangs on the eggplant tree, and the small sun-like tomatoes drag the green vine. Butterflies danced lightly in the vegetable garden. Cricket played strings for the accompaniment of the butterfly; learned to sing on the weeping willow beside the vegetable garden; frogs beat drums rhythmically under the lotus leaves; I carried the small basket in the vegetable garden Cutting the tender leek, the grasshopper jumped up and invited me to join in the party; there was a shout from my mother waiting for leek dumplings, and my little flower skirt flirted the butterfly out of the vegetable garden.
