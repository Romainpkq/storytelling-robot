Squirrel Squirrel likes to live on the tree, often nesting in the middle of the tree branch. When building a nest, it first moved some small branches, staggered and put them together, and then found some moss to spread on it, and then pressed the moss tightly and flattened it. The nest is built, and a cover is added to it, so that you are not afraid of wind and rain. The squirrel's nest is warm and safe.
