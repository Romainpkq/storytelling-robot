Little grass baby In our campus, there are two large lawns, and the cute little grass baby lives in it. In spring, the baby grass showed her little head and put on the green clothes sent by the spring girl, adding green to the campus, and the campus looks more beautiful. They are holding hands, side by side, dressing up the campus, bringing a lot of laughter to teachers and classmates. In summer, the baby grass grows taller and the clothes are greener. From a distance, it seems that the campus is covered with a green carpet. From a closer look, Sister Feng blows gently, and the baby grass nods, as if dancing! In autumn, the little grass baby wants to change clothes, so she wears yellow clothes made by autumn mother-in-law. Suddenly, the autumn wind blew and the yellow dress fell off, and the campus was like gold laid on the ground. In winter, the little grass baby is afraid of coming out of the cold, hiding in the ground to sleep, giving birth to the second year of life in the embrace of the earth. I love you, cute little grass baby, because you are the four seasons of our campus! In summer, the baby grass grows taller and the clothes are greener.
