Grandfather Dongdong rode on a donkey and lifted a cold whip all the way from the distant Siberian plains and came to us. The earth became a huge refrigerator. I was a flower-covered ice cream in the refrigerator. The sycamore turns into a gray coral, and the sparrow is a group of happy shuttle fish around the coral. The window turned into a beautiful screen. Frost was only a butterfly sleeping on the screen. The window turned into a beautiful screen. Frost was only a butterfly sleeping on the screen.
