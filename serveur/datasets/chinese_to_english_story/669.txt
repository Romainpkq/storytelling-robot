The walls "sweated" This morning, I just got up and suddenly found that the walls of my house were wet. Taking a closer look, it turned out that the walls were covered with small drops of water! Where did these small drops of water come from? Does the wall sweat too? I thought it was weird, so I went to ask my mother. My mother told me, "This is called the wall is still wet, because the weather is hot and the air is humid. It's going to rain soon." The walls are wet. Will it be naive to rain? I quickly looked at the sky through the window: the sky was gray, the sun had lost its former power, and the sun was not so bright. But there is no dark cloud in the sky. How could it rain? This weather lasted for two or three days, and it really rained. I finally understood: the walls "sweat" and it will rain. Haha, the wall has become a weather forecaster! Haha, the wall has become a weather forecaster!
