It is strange that Mr. Fox sent his son to school. The owl teacher asked the little fox to make a sentence "really weird". Outside the classroom window, Mr. Fox and his parents looked around. The little fox said proudly: "My dad showed sharp teeth when he was eating chicken at home. It was amazing; when my dad was smiling outside, he couldn't see a sharp tooth, it was strange!" Mr. Fox was so angry that he showed Mouth full of fangs. Then he immediately closed his mouth and showed a moving smile. The surrounding parents couldn't help but marvel: "It's weird!" When my father smiled outside, he couldn't see a sharp tooth, it was weird!
