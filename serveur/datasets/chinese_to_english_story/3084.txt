Dishwashing Tonight, after eating, I said to my mother: "Please rest, let me wash the dishes." Mother said cheerfully, "Can you do it?" I said, "Let me try it!" Happily agreed. So I stacked the bowls and plates together and brought them to the kitchen, where they were next to the sink. I first put hot water in the sink, and then a few drops of dishwashing liquid, and then I washed the dishes carefully. I took the dish towel in my right hand, and I took the dish in my left hand. I wiped it hard with the dishcloth. I wiped the inside and the outside until I wiped it clean. After washing one, I set it aside and started washing the second and third ... until the washing was finished. Then I put the bowls under the faucet and washed each bowl cleanly. Finally I put the bowl neatly in the cabinet. After all was completed, I happily said to my mother: "I have completed the task, please check." My mother checked it and said happily, "Baby, you are really capable!"
