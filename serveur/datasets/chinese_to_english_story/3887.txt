When I took a pen and wrote "River" in my little exercise book, a splash of water splashed in front of my eyes, and a palace rose from the bottom of the water. When my pen wrote "grassland", I saw the bees busy among the flowers, and two butterflies were twirling, and I could put them all in the net with a wave of my hand.
