The trees that "smoke" overnight, thousands of trees were covered with green buds, and the red and yellow flowers; but at the window of my house, a large tree seemed to be smoking. Will you read it wrong? I rubbed my eyes. Really, there were "light smoke" from the top of the tree. "Trees smoke, it 's incredible." I leaned closer to the windowsill and decided to see what happened. Under the leaves of the big tree, there are "fruit ears" hanging, "smoke" comes out from there, the "fruit ears" full of trees, and the "smoke" full of trees. What is going on here? It turned out that it was releasing "energy", releasing the "energy" stored in the winter, so that the spring grows more lush. Every spring they "smoke". How about a jasmine in the flower and a primrose in the tree? A tree that "smokes". It turned out that it was releasing "energy", releasing the "energy" stored in the winter, so that the spring grows more lush.
