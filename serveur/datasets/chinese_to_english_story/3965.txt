My home is in Hainan Island, where there are more fruits! There are bananas, candied dates, watermelons, etc., and coconuts that I like. The trunk of the coconut is straight and tall, and there are clusters of wide and long leaves on the top of the tree, like a fan. Under the long leaves, a string of coconuts grows, the dark green ones just grow out, the light green ones start to mature, and the brown ones are ripe.
