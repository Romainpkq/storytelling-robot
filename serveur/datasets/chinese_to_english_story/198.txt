Today is World Environmental Protection Day. The students formed a voluntary cleaning team. The teacher led us to the beach next to the school to pick up trash. We prepared large garbage bags, kegs and gloves and set off towards the rising sun. When we reached the beach, we found out that the place was no longer neat and odors were emitted. There are many plastic bags, empty plastic bottles, discarded tableware, and waste paper on the beach. We put on our gloves, each carrying a small bucket, and immediately went into battle. We put the garbage in a small bucket first, and after the small bucket is full, we dump it into a large garbage bag. With our efforts, there is no litter on the beach, and it has returned to its original beautiful appearance. We all laughed happily.
