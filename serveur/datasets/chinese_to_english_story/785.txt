During the break, Huizhen and I like to go to the playground to watch the classmates play rope skipping. Once, when Mr. Wang, who was on duty on the playground, saw it, he taught us the basic skills of skipping ropes, such as how to take off and how to shake the ropes ... Huizhen is very athletic and can learn as soon as he learns. And I tried many times without success and often tripped over the rope with a clumsy hand. Huizhen said to me, "It's okay, let's practice next time we take a break! I can practice with you, and I can definitely learn." In the rest of the rest, I worked hard with Huizhen on the playground. With the help of Huizhen, I gradually mastered some methods, and finally I can jump rope briskly. Both Huizhen and I laughed happily. Huizhen said to me, "It doesn't matter, next time we take a break, let 's practice again!
