Look at the goose, the white goose is coming: Stretching his neck, flapping his wings, squawking, "white," white, only a little yellow dotted on his head and claws, his body is fat and strong, and his long neck supports a small and exquisite head, The small eyes are slick, the flat mouth is always pecking and pecking, cute! I love the white goose, but I hate its domineering. He always relied on his own strength to make his chickens, ducks, dogs and cats at home obedient, but when he was slightly disobedient, he forced him by force. Those chickens, ducks, dogs and cats all became its "slaves." When eating, other "slave" can only eat leftovers when its belly is round and its wings flapped away. Every time I saw this situation, I screamed at it angrily: "You damn slave owner, now what time it is, see that I will not beat you to death."
