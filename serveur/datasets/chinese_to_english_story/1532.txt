The little sun is sick, and I accompany the sun, and the sun is warm. I turned my magic into a maggot, and a small orange turned into a round orange. "Oh, oh, I peeled the oranges and we ate them. You have one petal, I have one petal; you have one petal, I have one petal." After the oranges were eaten, I said, "The little sun is gone!" Hold me, kiss my red face, and say to me, "This is my little sun!" A little orange, the round oranges are red, just like the little sun.
