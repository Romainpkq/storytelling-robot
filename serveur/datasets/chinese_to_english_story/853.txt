In my painting classroom there is a "small grass green" garden. This is the poster for our class. The teacher said that the pictures and diaries in the posters were like small grasses, and they would thrive. I drew pictures for our posters and added a little green to "Little Grass Green". When I paint the sun, flowers and trees cannot be separated from the sun, so that the grass here grows more lush. I draw the woods again. The woods can block the wind and sand, and the air will become fresher. I will draw a modern garbage cleaning station to clean up the garbage and create a more beautiful environment. Do you say that I paint these paintings beautifully? I drew pictures for our posters and added a little green to "Little Grass Green".
