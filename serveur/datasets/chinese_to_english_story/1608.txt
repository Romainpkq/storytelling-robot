Sun Moon Lake is a beautiful lake in the central part of Taiwan Province of China. There is an island in Sun Moon Lake that divides the lake in half. One side of the lake looks like a round sun called "Sun Lake"; the other side looks like a crooked moon called "Moon Lake". The two lakes are connected by water, like a big green jade plate. An island is like a pearl in a jade plate. Sun Moon Lake is surrounded by mountains, and the mountains are densely wooded. The water in Sun Moon Lake is deep. The mountains and forests are reflected in the lake, and the lakes and mountains are very beautiful. I love the beautiful Sun Moon Lake and I love the Taiwan island of the motherland.
