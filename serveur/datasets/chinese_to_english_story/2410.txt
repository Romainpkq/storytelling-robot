On the way home from the traffic police, I can always see an uncle of the traffic policeman at the crossroads. He stood there with aura, wearing snow-white gloves on his hands, and directing traffic with gestures. His hand pointed to the east for a while, and to the south for a while. The vehicles in all directions passed through the crossroads in the direction indicated by his gestures. I think: With the uncle of the traffic policeman, the person driving the car will not be in trouble.
