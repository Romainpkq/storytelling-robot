The scene in Butterfly Valley is very charming. In some valleys, there is only one butterfly of yellow color. Under the sunshine, the golden light is very magnificent. In some valleys, there are several kinds of butterflies, flying up and down, colorful, just like who sprinkled a handful of colorful petals in the air and fluttered with the wind and flew away with the wind.
