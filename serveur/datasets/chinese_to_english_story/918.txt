In the clear stream, there is a crooked stream in front of the bunny's house. The stream is clear and bright, and it can reflect the blue sky. But one day, the rabbit suddenly found that the water in the stream in front of her house turned yellow. It was very strange, so I went down the stream and wanted to see what happened. The bunny walked and saw tall elephants and fat wild boars. They were breathing heavily, using all their strength to compete against a thick tree near the creek, and trying to compare who's strength . The little rabbit shouted to them as they ran, "Hurry up! You loosened the soil, and the soil fell into the stream, and we have no more clean water to drink!" Elephants and wild boars saw the rabbit His face flushed, and he knew everything was wrong, so he planted the tree back together. Soon the stream became clear again, shining the shadow of the white clouds on the blue sky. When the elephant and the wild boar saw the little rabbits' faces flushed, they knew they were wrong, and they planted the tree back together.
