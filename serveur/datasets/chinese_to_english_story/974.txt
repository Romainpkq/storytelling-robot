Little friend, thank you for the continuous drop of tap water on campus. I quietly closed the water pipe. The water pipe said: "Thank you, boy! On the grass, the plastic bag is so compressed that the grass is too tight. I bent down and picked up the plastic bag. Xiao Cao said: Children, thank you! By the side of Xiao Tang, a group of children are catching slugs. I urge them to put them back quickly. I said: "Thank you, my little friend! A small tree has been peeled off by the side of the road, and I immediately wrapped it with a cloth strip." Xiaoshu said: Thank you, my friend! On the grass, the plastic bag is so compressed that I can't breathe the grass. I bent down and picked up the plastic bag.
