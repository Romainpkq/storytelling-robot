The flower dog doctor asked the monkey laboratory technician to test the animal's blood. There are so many patients! Spiders, snails, shrimps, earthworms ... all here. The monkey laboratory technician took their blood out and put it in a glass tube. The test results came out, but Dr. Huagou found that there was no name on the glass tube. It turned out that the monkey laboratory technician forgot to write the name. The little monkey cried in a hurry. Flower dog said: "Don't worry, the green is the blood of the spider, the light blue is the blood of the snail, the blue is the blood of the shrimp, the rose is the blood of the earthworm." The monkey listened, and wrote carefully on the glass tube The name, and said: "In the future, I must be serious."
