There are many animals in the giant panda zoo, the most lovely one is the giant panda. The giant panda has a fat body, a short tail, and smooth hair. The limbs and shoulders are black, and the body and head are white. The most interesting are a pair of round black eyes and a pair of furry black ears. The giant panda was very lively when he was young, and liked to climb up and down. When I grow up, I do nâ€™t love much, I often hold my head in my paws, and sleep loudly. When he was asleep, you went to tease him, and he opened his eyes to look at you, and fell asleep again. When he woke up, he wobbled his fat body and walked around to find something to eat. He loves fresh bamboo leaves and bamboo shoots. The number of giant pandas is small and only produced in China. He is a very precious animal and a national treasure of our country.
