The brain writer Mark Twain received a letter from a young beginner in writing. The writer is very interested in such a question: "I heard that fish bones contain a lot of phosphorus, and phosphorus helps to fill the brain. So to become a world-famous writer, you must eat a lot of fish. Right? I wonder if this statement is realistic? "He asked again:" Do you also eat a lot of fish, what kind of fish do you eat? "Mark Twain wrote back:" It seems you have to eat a pair of whales It will do. "
