In the morning, the dewdrops gathered on the bright green leaves, crystal clear and translucent, like the shiny little pearls sprinkled on the green leaves. The blade shook gently, and a few small dewdrops hided into the grass mischievously, and could no longer be found. The sun had just lifted off the layers of clouds and laid out a golden smile, gazing lovingly at the land that had slept all night. In the cool morning breeze, the little dewdrop raised his round head and nodded slightly to the sun.
