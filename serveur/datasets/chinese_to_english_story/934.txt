If I am a snowflake If I am a snowflake When winter comes, I will cover the crops with a quilt. If I were a snowflake, when spring flowers bloom, I will turn into spring water to water the soil. If I were a snowflake, I would freeze the pests and make the earth clean and tidy. If I were a snowflake, I would dance around the children and bring them joy. I would like to make a snowflake! If I were a snowflake, when spring flowers bloom, I will turn into spring water to water the soil.
