Save the eggs in the wind. The big trees were blown up and down. The little kangaroo went to see the houses of the partners. Did they get damaged by the wind? He walked under a big tree, and only heard the sound of hula, another strong wind came, a bird's nest was blown over, and several eggs rolled down. One, two, three ... The bird eggs fell into the kangaroo's pocket, the kangaroo's pocket was warm, and the bird eggs were safe inside. The kangaroo walked from house to house, and the partners' houses were very good. When he returned to the bottom of the tree, the wind had stopped, and I saw the mother bird flying from a distance. She was anxiously shouting, "Where is the egg baby in my nest!" "Here it is!" Said the kangaroo. The eggs are in the warm pockets of the kangaroo. They have already hatched a group of little birds. They stretch out their little heads and howl at the bird mother! The bird's eggs have fallen into the kangaroo's pocket. The kangaroo's pocket is warm. The bird's eggs are safe inside.
