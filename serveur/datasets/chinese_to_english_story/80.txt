The kettle that I can call Today, my mother bought a new kettle. From the appearance, it is the same as the ordinary kettle, but it has an obvious feature-it will be called. When the water boils, it will make a whistle, as if shouting: "Water is boiling! Water is boiling!" Why is it called? After careful observation, I found that there was a whistle on its cover. When the water was boiled, the water vapour in the pot could only come out of the whistle because the lid was tight. Then the whistle rang. I thought: This kettle is simple and practical, and the person who invented it is really smart! When the water was boiled, the water vapour in the pot could only come out of the whistle because the lid was tight. Then the whistle rang.
