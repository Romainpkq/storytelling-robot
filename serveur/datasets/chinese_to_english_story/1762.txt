Little solar system There is a little solar system in my family. Of course, the little sun is me! Everyone turned around me. Venus' father has very strict requirements for my studies, and I never miss a typo. Mother Mercury cares about me in life, and the weather suddenly gets cold. She sends her clothes to school for me to wear; Grandpa is the most respected and most afraid of me Person, but he can often tell me stories; Grandma Mars hurts me most and loves me, she is still my teacher of enlightenment; Grandpa Jupiter picks me up at school every day at noon; Grandma Saturn cooks my favorite dishes; Uncle Uranus, Neptune 婶婶 often buys me food and fun things; the lovely little Pluto sister-well, is my happy little friend. How happy and happy I am to live in this solar system! How happy and happy I am to live in this solar system!
