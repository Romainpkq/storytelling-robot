One winter, Lenin recuperates in the suburbs. He walks in the park every day. There is a tall birch tree in the park. There are three gray finches on the tree: two breasts are pink and one breast is crimson. They beat back and forth among the branches and sing softly, which is very lovable. Every time Lenin walked under the birch tree, he had to stop, looking up at these three cheerful gray finches, and often brought breadcrumbs and grains to them.
