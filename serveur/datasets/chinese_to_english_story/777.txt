Some time ago, my father bought me a golden bear. The golden bear has beautiful ears, a round nose, and thick fluff. It looks very cute. My brother and I often feed it, sometimes it feeds cabbage, sometimes it feeds rapeseed, and sometimes it feeds peanuts. It tastes delicious. One day, the golden bear bit the big cardboard box it lived in and escaped. We are in a hurry, looking for it everywhere. It was really interesting to catch it under the kitchen cabinet.
