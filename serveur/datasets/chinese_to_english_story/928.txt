Finding Horses in Washington There is a cute pony in Washington. One day, he took the pony out to play. Seeing a few mares, the pony broke the reins and followed the mares into John's house. So Washington and his dad came to John 's house and wanted to return to their pony, but John said that the pony was his. Washington thought about it, went to the pony, covered his eyes with his hands and said to John, "If this is really your horse, which eye do you say is blind?" John Zhiwu said, "Left , Left eye. "Washington shook his head. John hurriedly changed his mouth and said, "Oh, it's the right eye." Washington put his hands down, and John saw that both eyes of the pony were good. John bowed his head in shame. Washington took his pony happily home. Seeing a few mares, the pony broke the reins and followed the mares into John's house.
