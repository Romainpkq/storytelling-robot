Why the morning and night sun is so red The sun rises early in the morning or is always red when the mountain is going to go down in the evening, like the cute face of a child. It turned out that the atmosphere "tinted" the sun red. Sunlight is made up of 7 colors of red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. When these seven colors of light appeared in a neat line together, what we saw was white light. We know that there is a very thick atmosphere around the earth. There are a lot of dust and small water droplets in this atmosphere. When the sun shines on the earth, it must first pass through the atmosphere. The naughty little ones, such as dust and small water droplets, will diffuse the sun or simply block it back. In the morning or evening sun, almost only red and orange light bravely broke through the atmosphere blocking them and shot into our eyes, so the sun we saw in the morning and evening was always red.
