There are many animals in the giant panda zoo, the most lovely one is the giant panda. The giant panda is five fat and has a short tail and smooth hair. The limbs and shoulders are black, and the body and head are white. The most interesting is a pair of round dark circles, a pair of furry black ears. The giant panda was very lively when he was a child, and he liked to climb up and down. When I grow up, I don't like much activities. I often hold my head in my paws and sleep a lot. When he was asleep, you tease it, it opened its eyes to see you, and fell asleep again. When he wakes up, he swings his fat body and walks around to find something to eat. He loves to eat fresh bamboo leaves and bamboo shoots. The pandas are few in number and only produced in China. He is a very precious animal and a national treasure of our country.
