Autumn rain is long. The silent rain silk washed everything on the ground brightly, and even the fallen leaves on the ground were coated with a layer of gold. A pair of little feet wearing colored rubber shoes, walking on the road covered with gold leaves, came out of a line of colored poems. A small umbrella full of flowers floats on the road covered with gold leaves into a beautiful song.
