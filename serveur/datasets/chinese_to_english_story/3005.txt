My mark is very short, with small eyes, a small nose, and a small mouth concentrated on my face, but the pair of big ears are especially conspicuous. When I was a child, I was very naughty. Therefore, my ears often suffered like this: my father pulled the left ear, and my mother pulled the right ear, so as to punish me. Listening to my mother, when I fell to the ground, she noticed at a glance that I had a small ear on my right ear, and thought it was my mark, and thought it was hereditary. Anyone who has seen me at a glance says that I am very clever and must be very productive and blessed in the future. I asked them why, they said: "Because you have a little ear longer than others." In fact, whether people will have a good future, whether they are blessed, has nothing to do with their ears, they must rely on their diligence and hard work, Did you say that?
