Flying up The animals on the ground saw the birds flying in the sky, and everyone was very envious. Sister Magpie said, "You have no wings, you can never fly!" The frog said unconvinced, "I want to fly!" So he blew a big balloon. The frog flew up holding the balloon. It was so happy. The little white rabbit saw it and said, "Let me try it too!" Then he made a beautiful kite with beautiful silk cloth. The little white rabbit flew up with the kite, it was so happy. The little bear saw the frog and the white rabbit flying and thought, "I can do it." So he built an airplane. The little bear flew into the sky with his plane. "Oh, it flies!" It was so excited. The elephant saw the bear cub also flew up and thought, "I have a better way." So he built a spaceship. The elephant flew through the sky in a spaceship, flying higher and farther. Sister Magpie saw this scene and thought about it and said, "It seems that as long as you use your brain, there is nothing you can't do." The elephant broke through the blue sky in a spaceship, flying higher and farther.
