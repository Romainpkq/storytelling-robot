Peacocks, starlings, and hens used to have a farmer who built a house in the woods, which was strong and spacious. The birds in the woods want to move into this house and live with the farmer. Peacock ran to the farmer first and said, "Let me live with you! I look best, open the tail, and look as beautiful as flowers." Then, the starling came to the farmer and said, "Let me live with you. Let's be together! My mouth is the most coincident. Whatever you say, I will say it, and I will definitely tell you to listen. "At this time, a hen came. The farmer asked the hen: "What skills do you have?" The hen smiled and said, "I'm neither pretty nor good at mouth. What I can do is lay eggs." The farmer listened to the hen and said: "An egg down the earth is more valuable than fiddling a hundred times with beautiful feathers and saying a thousand nice words. Hardworking and willing hens, welcome you to live here." Peacock and starling listened to the farmer , Embarrassed to leave.
