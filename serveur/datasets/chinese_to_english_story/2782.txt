The little painter in the snow is snowing! It's snowing! A group of small painters came in the snow. Chicks paint bamboo leaves, puppies paint plum blossoms, ducks paint maple leaves, and ponies paint crescents. Without paint, without a paintbrush, a picture can be made in a few steps. Why didn't the frog participate? It hid in the hole to sleep!
