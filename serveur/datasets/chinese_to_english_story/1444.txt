On the day of picking the water, the mother got up before the chicken barked. She gently opened the door and saw a figure in the hazy night, struggling to pour water into the water tank while holding a bucket. The mother hurried over and saw that it turned out to be her son Zhu De. Mother touched Zhu De's tender shoulder and felt sad for a while. "Mom, don't worry, I can do it!" Then, Zhu De picked up the bucket again and walked out of the kitchen. Looking at the back of this sensible child, the mother thought to herself, "It's really pleasant to be so considerate of the elders and bear hardships at such a young age!" Mother touched Zhu De's tender shoulders and felt sad.
