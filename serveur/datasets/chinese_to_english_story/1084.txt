Little cousin My little cousin is under one year old. She doesn't speak, she just cry loudly. A chubby face with big round eyes is very cute. She wore a small wooden fish on her wrist and made a crisp sound as soon as she moved. Whenever she saw me, she always smiled. I tease her with a toy, but it treats the toy as delicious and sends it to my mouth, silly, it's really fun. When she was unhappy, she pulled my hair vigorously with her hands, and her mouth babbled and said something that no one could understand. However, I don't blame her because she is my little cousin who is not yet sensible. I tease her with a toy, but it treats the toy as delicious and sends it to my mouth, silly, it's really fun.
