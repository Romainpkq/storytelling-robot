Washing the dishesTonight, after eating, I said to my mother, "Let's rest, let me wash the dishes." Mom said cheerfully, "Can you do it?" I said, "Let me try it!" Mom I happily agreed. So I stacked the bowls and plates together and brought them to the kitchen, where I placed them next to the sink. I put hot water in the sink first, dripped a few drops of detergent, and then carefully washed the bowl. I took a dishwasher in my right hand and a bowl in my left hand and rubbed it hard with a dishcloth. I wiped the inside out and then the outside until it was clean. After washing one, I set it aside and started washing the second and third ... until it was finished. Then I put the bowls under the faucet and cleaned each bowl thoroughly. In the end I put the bowls neatly in the cabinet. After all was done, I happily said to my mother, "I have completed the task, please check." The mother checked it, and happily said, "Baby, you are really capable!" I listened, and my heart was so sweet.
