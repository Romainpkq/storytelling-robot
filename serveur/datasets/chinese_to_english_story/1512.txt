What is the Earth Hi, I am sitting in a spaceship to heaven to see what the Earth looks like. The earth turned out to be a big ball, and it was covered in flower clothes. The green places are: forests, crops and grasslands. The blue places are: rivers, lakes and oceans. The yellow place is: the desert where the yellow sand is flying. It is like the waves: high and low mountains. The white places are: the snow-covered South Pole and the North Pole. Ah, I returned to the earth in a spaceship, and now I know what the earth is like.
