What a beautiful summer night, it is quiet, the flowers are asleep, the grass is asleep, and the trees are asleep. In the pool, the water lily closed its beautiful eyes. On the big green leaves, there is a dragonfly parked, like a small plane parked on the airport. In the grass by the pool, the frog sang screaming, and the golden bells rattled. In the sky, the mother-in-law Moon smiled and raised her eyebrows, and the stars blinked her naughty eyes. The wind blows gently. The fireflies carried small lanterns and flew in the sky, blinking blinking, blinking blinking ... how beautiful the summer night was!
