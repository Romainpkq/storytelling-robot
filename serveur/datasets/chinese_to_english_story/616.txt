When it was raining, the little white rabbit was picking mushrooms on the grass and was having a good time. Suddenly, it was blowing wind and rain. The little white rabbit hurriedly picked a large tree leaf and put it on its head as an umbrella. It won't rain anymore. Suddenly, it saw a chick screaming. "Chick, come under the leaves!" So the chick and the little white rabbit walked forward with the big leaves. They saw the kitten meowing in the rain again. "Little cat, come under the leaves!" So three of them were hiding under the big leaves. The rain stopped and they were happily playing together again. The rain stopped and they were happily playing together again.
