Why don't I rank first?" The second thumb quit, and hurriedly said, "I am the most amazing. People do whatever I used to give pointers. Where is your business? "The middle finger didn't wait for the second thumb to finish, and quickly stood up to argue," Look at it fast, straighten five fingers, the highest than anyone else. " ...... The ring finger and little finger are not to be outdone, they all show their housekeeping skills and argue with them. Their quarrel was heard by the flower ball in the corner, and the flower ball gave them a suggestion: See who can take it, whoever has the most credit. The five fingers looked at each other, and they all felt that the proposal was feasible, so they each flexed their hands and tried each one, but none of them could pick it up. The flower ball also made another suggestion: What would happen if you brought five fingers together? Five fingers went into battle, and as soon as they were gently picked, they were picked up. With five fingers, you look at me, I look at you, and smile embarrassedly. "The middle finger didn't wait for the second thumb to finish, and quickly got up to argue," Look at it, look at it, straighten your five fingers, which is the highest than anyone else. "
