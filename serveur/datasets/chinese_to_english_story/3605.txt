In early spring, the earth awakened from a deep sleep. There was a scent of mud in the fields; the grass spewed out tender young sprouts, peering curiously at the world; the girls wore magnificent clothes and sang happily on the green grass. Wan Mu fought for the spring, the creeks clashed, and jade-like carpets were spread on both sides. Looking up and looking, nature is full of life, intoxicating and fascinating.
