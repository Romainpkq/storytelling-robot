In the early winter morning, a thick white mist. The towers and hills in the distance were gone. The fields and woods in the immediate vicinity are separated by a layer of veil, which is unclear. The sun like a red ball slowly rises and emits a faint light, not dazzling at all. The crops in the field have been collected, and people are busy collecting cabbage in the garden. The fog dispersed slowly and the sun shone out. The towers and hills in the distance can be seen. The fields and woods nearby were also clearly seen. There are many big persimmons hanging on the persimmon tree, like red lanterns one by one. There was a thick layer of yellow leaves in the woods. Only the pine and cypress trees were not afraid of the cold, but still green. The sun like a red ball slowly rises and emits a faint light, not dazzling at all.
