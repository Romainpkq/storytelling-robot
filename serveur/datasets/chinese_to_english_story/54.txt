What color is the sun? When the sun kisses an apple, the apple turns red. When the sun kisses the banana, the banana turns yellow. The sun kissed the leaves, and the leaves turned green. The sun kissed the grapes, and the grapes became purple. So what color is the sun? I think the color of the sun must be colorful. All the most beautiful colors in the world come from the sun. The world is beautiful, first of all because the sun is beautiful. All the most beautiful colors in the world come from the sun.
