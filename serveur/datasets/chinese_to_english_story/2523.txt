In the evening of the rainbow, the rain stopped. I opened the window and looked at the clear sky to the west. "What a beautiful rainbow!" I said aloud. The younger brother heard the sound and came to the window. A long rainbow stretched in the clear sky to the west, and it looked like a bridge. Red, yellow, green, orange, purple, these colors are very bright. I hurriedly ran out of the house, and ran towards Rainbow Flying. I want to run under the rainbow and look up. Run, run, but no matter how I run, I can't catch up with the rainbow. The younger brother looked like me, opened his hands, and looked very happy. Rainbow, you are so beautiful.
