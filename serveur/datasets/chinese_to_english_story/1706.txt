He stepped forward and asked, "Brother Niu, how many potatoes did you ask to carry it?" Jinjin is not dry yet, Jinjin! Don't dream anymore! "Brother Niu said seriously:" It's not me who don't dream anymore, but you don't get confused! What's ten kilograms of potato? Friendship weighs so much! " The donkey listened to Brother Niu's words, stood with that long ear, dropped his head and embarrassedly left. The donkey listened to Brother Niu's words, stood there with his long ears, dropped his head, and left embarrassedly.
