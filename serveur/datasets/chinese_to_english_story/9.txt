A good friend has a little cat in the zoo, which looks very cute. The little animals like to approach it and they all want to be friends with it. One day, the little cat was drawing by the river. The rabbit said: "The kitten is so good at drawing, it is really a big painter." The little fox said, "This painting is so good that you can take it to the competition." The puppy said, "Not only can you participate in the competition, but You can get the first place! "Pig said," This picture is not good at all. How can a chick swim in the water? Goldfish can't get on the tree! "The kitten smiled embarrassedly, it said: "Thank you for pointing out my mistake. You are really my good friend." The kitten smiled embarrassedly, and said, "Thank you for pointing out my mistake. You are really my good friend.
