It's snowing It's snowing, it's snowing! Snowflakes fell from the sky. The snow is getting bigger and bigger, like goose feathers, like cotton wool, like white butterflies. It looks great. The snow stopped, the ground was white, the house was white, and the whole earth was white. Children make snowmen and fight snowballs in the snow. They are so happy! The snow stopped, the ground was white, the house was white, and the whole land was all white.
