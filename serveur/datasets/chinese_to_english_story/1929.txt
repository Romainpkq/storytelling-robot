It 's so nice here on a little desert island that a bear lives. The bear felt lonely and dreamed of playing with many friends every day when he slept. Seeing a cloud floating in the sky, the bear hurriedly asked, "Clouds and clouds, how can I find my friends?" Yuner didn't speak, and fluttered into a tree. The little bear understood. He planted and planted many island saplings on the island. One year, two years, the small saplings grew up, and the mountains and the fields were covered with green leaves. A little bird flew up: "Ah, it's nice here! I'll live here!" Many birds came and all lived here. Fallow deer, baby elephant, baby monkey, all came by boat: "Ah, this is great! Let's live here!" The bear was so happy, he kept saying, "Welcome you Welcome you! "Winnie was very happy and kept saying," Welcome you!
