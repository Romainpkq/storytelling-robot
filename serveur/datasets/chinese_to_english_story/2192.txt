The story of Mrs. Curie when she was a child More than 100 years ago, there was a little girl named Maria in Poland who was very attentive in her studies. No matter how noisy is around, she can't distract her. Once, Maria was doing her homework. Her sister and classmates sang, danced, and played games in front of her. As if she hadn't seen it, Maria read the book intently on the side. My sister and classmates want to try her out. They quietly put up a few stools behind Maria, as long as Maria moved, the stool would fall down. Time passed by one minute and one second. Maria had finished reading a book, and the stool was still standing there. Since then, my sister and classmates no longer tease her, and like Maria, she concentrates on studying and studying hard. When Maria grew up, she became a great scientist. She is Mrs. Curie.
