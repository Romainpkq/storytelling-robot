Dewdrop Dewdrop has a very small body and a short life, but it is extraordinary. When the night is shrouded, it nourishes the seedlings like a mother breastfeeding her baby; when dawn comes, it opens its tireless eyes for the first time; it hides in the air during the day, silently in the dark at night Working. It does not show off its power like a rainstorm and thunder, nor is it cruel and merciless to everything like hail. It worked silently and passed away silently. It devoted a short life to He Miao, but had nothing to do with He Miao. How much it is like a hard-working gardener who cultivates the flowers of the motherland; how much like our beloved teacher, working under the lamp at night and day and night, pouring the life's hard work into our heart!
