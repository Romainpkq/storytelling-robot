Today, my mother took us to the market. There are so many vegetables in the market! There are chubby bean sprouts, red radish, round winter melon, and tender bamboo shoots. My mother picked up a green, sickle-like vegetable and asked me what it was called. I replied: "Edamame." The aunt who sold the vegetables smiled and said, "This isn't Edamame. It's a sword bean." The aunt said with a smile, "This is not edamame, it's sword beans.
