Winter is here, and the little frog is still swimming in the small pond. How nice to find a companion to play with! The little frog asked Loach: "Let's play together?" Loach said: "It's cold, I'm going to drill into the bed for winter!" After that, I went into the soft river and disappeared. The little frog asked a small carp beside him: "Let's play together!" The small carp shook his head and said, "We all sleep together in the winter!" How should the little frog spend the winter? Winter is here, and the little frog is still swimming in the small pond.
