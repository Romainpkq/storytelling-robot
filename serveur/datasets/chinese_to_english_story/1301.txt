Beautiful bubbles In the bright sun, we blew colorful bubbles. Big and small bubbles fly towards the blue sky. Some resemble a small dewdrop, and some resemble beautiful colored balls. Bubbles fly to the classroom, come to visit our classroom; bubbles fly to space, and dance with the stars in the sky; bubbles fly to the lawn, holding hands with the grass, side by side, beautiful! Beautiful In the bright sun, we blew colorful bubbles.
