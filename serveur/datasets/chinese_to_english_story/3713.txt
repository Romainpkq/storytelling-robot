In the winter of Mi Jia's diary, Mi Jia slid down the hillside on a sleigh and went skating on the river with his friends. He happily wrote a diary: "Winter is really interesting. I hope it will always be winter." Spring is here. Mijia looks at the flowers on the green grass and chases the butterflies. He happily wrote a diary: "Spring is beautiful, I hope it will always be spring." When summer comes, Mi Jia catches small fish, gathers wild fruits, and turns over under the shade of the trees. He happily wrote a diary: "Summer is really happy, I hope it will always be summer." In autumn, the orchards in the orchard are red and bright, and the pears are yellow and clear. Mi Jia wrote a diary with satisfaction: "Autumn is so lovely. I hope it will always be autumn."
