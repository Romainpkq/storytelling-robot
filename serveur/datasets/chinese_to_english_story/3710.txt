Once, Wang Xizhi went out for a walk and saw an old lady selling a fan by the roadside. She called for a long time, but no one came to buy a fan. Seeing her disappointment, Wang Xizhi was very sympathetic to her, so he took the fan, wrote some words on it, and asked the old woman to take it to the market and sell it. The old woman came to the market, and the people there recognized that the words on the fan were written by Wang Xizhi, and they were battling to buy a fan. After a while, all the fans were sold out.
