Xiaoshan Village My family lives in Xiaoshan Village. There is an orchard on the hillside. It is full of pink peach blossoms and white pear blossoms. There is a beautiful new house at the foot of the mountain. That is our school. There is a small river in front of the school. The water is crystal clear, and sometimes you can see small fish swimming around. Looking up, the newly built mountain road twisted and stretched into the distance. I love my small mountain village, I love my hometown. There is a beautiful new house at the foot of the mountain. That is our school.
