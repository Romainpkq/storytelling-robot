There is an old and tall jujube tree in my yard. In spring, jujube trees are covered with light yellow jujube flowers. In summer, the flowers are falling, and jujube trees are full of young green dates. In autumn, Xiaoqingzao slowly turned red, and became a very large and large jujube. At this time, the trees seemed to be full of small round lanterns. My child and I stood under the tree and looked up at these red dates. How happy! At the end of autumn and the beginning of winter, we were eating red and sweet dates, and we were very grateful to those who planted date trees.
