Happy little snail. I am a happy little snail. My shell is my house. I take it with me in the green fields every day. There are tender green grass, sweet dew, and dragonflies and butterflies playing with me. My favorite is the rainy day, because the humid environment makes me feel particularly comfortable. After the rain clears, children can often see me when they come out to play. At this time, I may drink dew slowly on the blades of grass, stretch out on the ground to breathe the fresh air, or stand on the sunflower to enjoy the scenery in the distance ... I like my life very much. Once, I climbed hard to the tree and saw a park not far away. There are bright flowers in the park, beautiful rockery, and a group of happy children. The children are playing happily, chasing each other, and there is a continuous burst of joyful laughter. I secretly thought: Although I climb slowly, I must climb hard. If I can go to the park and play with the children, then I will be happier!
