Kittens, puppies, and pigs are painting together. The little cat drew a sun, drew a house, drew a big tree, and a little bird stopped on the tree. It said to the little pig: "Look, I can draw anything!" The little pig said: "You are so smart." But the puppy said: "Can you paint the wind? The wind, you can't see it, you can't touch it. No one can draw it. "The kitten picked up the pen and gently tapped her lips, blinked her eyes, thought for a while, and said," I can! "It was next to the sun, and a white cloud was painted on the house, saying:" The white cloud is floating in the sky, Did n’t the wind blow? The wind, it ’s drawn! "
