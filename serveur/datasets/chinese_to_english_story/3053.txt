My family has a little white rabbit, which is very cute. The little white rabbit's fur is snow-white, and it looks like a bunch of glittering snowflakes in the bright sunlight. It has a pair of long ears erected on its head, as long as there is movement, it will oscillate non-stop. The most beautiful thing is its pair of big red eyes, which are really like rubies embedded in white jade. I like the little white rabbit very much and give it fresh grass every day.
