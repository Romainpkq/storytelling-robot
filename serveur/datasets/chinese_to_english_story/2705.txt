The beautiful umbrella flowers are raining. Pedestrians on the street are all holding umbrellas. From afar, they look like beautiful flowers. Some are red, some are black, some are yellow, some are green, and some are transparent. The whole street looks like it is full of colorful flowers. These "flowers" have feet and walk around the street.
