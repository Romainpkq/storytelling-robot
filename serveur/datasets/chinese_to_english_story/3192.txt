It was dawn, and the eastern sky revealed the white color of the fish belly. Gradually, the white of the fish belly turned pale red, as if the redness appeared on people's faces after drinking a bit of wine. Then it slowly changed from light red to deep red, and then from deep red to golden color. At this time, the surrounding white clouds seemed to be painted with colorful colors: like golden apples for a while, like purple grapes for a while, and sapphires, pearls, colored jade for a while ... it was truly magnificent and unpredictable.
