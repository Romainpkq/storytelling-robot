Lights of Beijing City At night, the city of Beijing is full of lights, which are beautiful and beautiful. The vehicles on both sides of the road are flashing lights, shuttle between them; the street lights on both sides are standing high, shining brightly, like standing soldiers standing guard; the tall residential buildings are lit, and the people under the lights must be eating or reading books, watching TV, Chatting, the children must be playing or writing homework; the bustling shopping mall is lit, the bustling crowd is in and out, some are preparing to go shopping, some are shopping, and go home happily with a satisfied smile; The Beijing Library is lit, and the people inside must be reading books seriously or looking for information; the CCTV tower is draped with colored lights: red, yellow, blue, green, pink, and purple woven colorful clothes , Very spectacular and beautiful. I like the Beijing city at night, it is so quiet, beautiful and prosperous.
