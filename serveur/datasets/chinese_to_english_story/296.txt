One day after Swift, Swift was hunting for a pest, and the peacock stopped and shouted it, saying proudly: "Hey! Look at how beautiful my clothes are, but your clothes are not beautiful at all." Swift hummed, and replied : "I can eat five or six thousand pests a day, you, you only show yourself when there are a lot of people." The peacock listened, and walked away with a red face. You see how beautiful my clothes are, but your clothes are not beautiful at all.
