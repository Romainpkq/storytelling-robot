"Lazy" Dad, I'm the "little princess" at home. Parents are watching me like stars. Grandma spoiled me, so I might be hungry, frozen, and tired; my mother would be used to me, so I might be wronged. Only Dad, I have often been ignorant of me recently. What's going on? In the past, when I was doing my homework, I ran into problems that I wouldn't do. As long as I asked Dad, he would tell me the answer. But during these days, I found that my father became "lazy", and asked no questions in ten. Sometimes I looked at me sternly, and when I asked again, he said, "Read the book by yourself to find the answer." I had to read the book to check the information. Although the answer was found, it took me a lot of time, but every time I found the answer, I would vaguely feel the smile in my father's eyes. Today, I ran into a problem that I had never seen before, and after racking my brain, I couldn't do it. I had to ask my father: "Dad, I have never seen this question before, can you teach me?" My heart pounded straight, lest my father would refuse me. Dad glanced at me and said, "Have you checked the book?" I replied: "There are no questions of this type in the book." "You do other homework first." After that, Dad entered the room. I had to go back to my room. After a while, my father took a book and came to my room. The answer was clearly written on the book. He explained it to me carefully and asked me to do it again. After I finished the question, I flipped through the small book and found that there were records on the questions I had asked before. I finally learned the reason why my dad became "lazy". With a stern and irrational attitude, he cultivated my ability to think independently and solve problems. In a unique way, he expressed his fierce love and sincere love for children.
