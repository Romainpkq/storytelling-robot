Washington cut down the cherry tree George Washington was the first president of the United States. He was a smart and naughty child as a child. One day, his father gave him a small axe. That little axe is brand new and brand new, small and sharp. Little George is happy! He thought that his father's big axe could cut down the big tree, can my little axe cut down the small tree? I want to give it a try. He saw a cherry tree by the garden, and the breeze swayed it, as if beckoning to him: "Come on, little George, try your little axe on me!" Little George was happy I ran over and raised the axe to cut down the cherry tree, and once, twice ... the cherry tree fell to the ground. He used a small axe to cut off the branches and leaves of the small tree, clamped the small stick between the two legs, held the small ax in one hand, and held the small stick in one hand, playing a game of horse riding and fighting in the garden. After a while, my father came back and was very angry when he saw the beloved cherry tree falling to the ground. He asked Little George: "Did you cut down my cherry tree?" Then Little George realized that he was in trouble, and thought, "I must endure my dad today!" But he never loved lying, so he said to his father, "Dad! I cut down your cherry tree. I want to try a little axe." Father heard George's words, not only did not hit him, but also gave him a shot.

Little George Looking at his father, he nodded sensibly. He asked little George, "Did you cut down my cherry tree?
