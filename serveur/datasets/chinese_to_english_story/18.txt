The lovely big flower clock is here in spring. The little bee is really hardworking and came to the garden early in the morning to collect nectar. It flies in and out of flowers to gather honey. Suddenly, Sunflower said to the bee, "Let's take a break, it's time to go home for lunch." The little bee asked, "It's noon? How do you know?" Sunflower said mysteriously: "We have a big flower clock here Ah! "The bee glanced around:" Where is the big flower clock? "The lark flew over and fluttered her beautiful wings, and said with a smile:" Little bee, I know where, let's go and see this big flower Bell! "So he flew to a large flower pan. Although there were many flowers in it, most of them were not in bloom, only one kind of flower was opening. Lark said: "This kind of flower is called noon flower. She only blooms at noon. Of course, she is now blooming at noon!" The bee asked: "Is the flower opening time fixed?" Lark said: "Of course, different flowers will open at different times: hops open at three in the morning, morning glory usually blooms at four, rose at five, rose at 6 o'clock, peony at seven, lotus At eight o'clock, at ten o'clock is Banzhilian. "" Without an alarm clock, the circadian clock in their bodies wakes them up! "" I have learned another way to master time! "Said the bee happily. The lark said: "This flower is called 'Noon Flower'. She only blooms at noon. Of course she is blooming now at noon!
