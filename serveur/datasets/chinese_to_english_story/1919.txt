There is a sika deer and a golden monkey living in the forest than they are, and they both feel that they are more capable. Uncle Elephant said, "I'll test you two. There is a fruit tree on the other side of the river, and the tree is full of fruit. Whoever of you picks the fruit first, even if you are good at it." Sika thought: "I run fast, I must be able to pick the fruit first. "The golden monkey thought," I have the best ability to pick fruit from the tree. I must be able to pick the fruit first. "The game began. The sika deer hurried forward, and with a light jump, they crossed the stream. He ran under the fruit tree in a hurry, thinking proudly, "I'm still good at it." But the fruit tree was too high, and he jumped and jumped. At this time, the golden monkey was blocked by the river and couldn't cross the river. It was in a hurry to turn around. Uncle Elephant came over and said, "If you think of a way, you can pick the fruit." They understood at once. The sika deer picked up a golden monkey and crossed the stream. The golden monkey soon climbed up the tree and picked the fruits. Together they gave the fruits to the elephant uncle. Uncle Elephant asked: "Who are you capable of?" Sika deer and golden monkey. Look at me, look at you, and laugh. The sika deer picked up a golden monkey and crossed the stream.
