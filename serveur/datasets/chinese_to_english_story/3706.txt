The dawn is not yet bright, the ground is still awake, and the moon and stars here have not yet gone down. Dawn put on new clothes and walked out of the house with joy. The laughter awakened the sky, awakened the earth, the moon fell, the stars were gone, the sun rose, the dawn brought the morning glow, and floated to another heaven and earth.
