Animals are really interesting. Butterflies fluttered on the flowers, just like flying flowers, beautiful! Knowing that they screamed loudly on the tree, and the bees hummed softly under the tree, they were like singers. The wild geese fly in the sky. They are lined up as "one" and lined up as "people". The woodpecker who was healing the tree saw it and whispered, "A big wild goose is like a calligrapher!" Do you like animals? The wild geese fly in the sky. They are lined up as "one" and lined up as "people".
