There are many rare animals in China, and the most lovely ones are giant pandas. The panda's body is chubby, its tail is short, its fur is smooth, its head and body are white, and its limbs are black. It has a pair of furry black ears on its head and two round dark circles. When pandas are small, they are very lively and like to climb up and down. When I grow up, I don't like much activities. I often hold my head in my paws and sleep a lot. If you go to tease it, it will open its eyes and take a look, and then fall asleep again. Sometimes it swings its chubby body, walking around to find something to eat. Giant pandas like to eat fresh bamboo leaves and bamboo shoots. You see, it embraces bamboo, and it tastes delicious.
