I like rain. The rain of spring germinates the seeds, and the land is a pink willow green. The rain in summer bathed the ground and people felt cool. The rain of autumn put a golden coat on the earth, and the earth was harvested. However, yesterday's rain was terrible. It was like someone in the sky poured down a pot of water, washed out the road, and damaged the crops. Rain brings many benefits to people and sometimes brings disasters to people. I like rain.
