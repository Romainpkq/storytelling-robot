One day, the careless little monkey listened to the teacher and said, "The fruit is red and sweet ..." The little monkey ran out of the classroom and ran out into the field before he finished listening. what ! The apples on the tree were red, so they picked a big bite and ate it. It was so sweet! When he saw that the peach was big and red, he went to pick the peach, which was sweet and quenched his thirst. He thought the teacher was right, red fruits are all sweet. He walked around and saw a piece of hot peppers. The red hot peppers were like small lanterns, which made people love it. The little monkey picked a big red one and put it in his mouth. what ! The little monkey was sweating spicyly. He ran back to school desperately and asked the teacher: "How come this red fruit is not sweet?" The teacher said: "The red ones are not necessarily all sweet. I haven't finished speaking, why did you run away? "" The little monkey listened and bowed his head embarrassedly. From then on, the little monkey studied very seriously and became a good student.
