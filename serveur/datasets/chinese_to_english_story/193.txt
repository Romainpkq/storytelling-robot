The Mid-Autumn Festival is here, and sweet-scented osmanthus blooms. The sweet smell of osmanthus is everywhere in the community. Step forward and look closely, you will find clusters of golden osmanthus in the green leaves. Each little flower has four tiny petals and is very cute. As soon as the wind blew, little osmanthus flowers fell, and it began to rain golden osmanthus. Dad told me that sweet-scented osmanthus has different colors. The golden yellow is called Jin Gui, the silvery white is called Yin Gui, and the orange-red is called Dan Gui. Dad told me that sweet-scented osmanthus has different colors.
