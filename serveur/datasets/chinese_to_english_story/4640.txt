The beautiful sea, the sea, the blue, the wide and the wide. The beach, yellow and yellow, is long and soft. The snow-white waves rushed to the beach, leaving many small shells. The children laughed happily and ran to the beach. They picked up the little shells, put on beautiful necklaces, and hung them on their chests. The children happily ran around on the beach and gave joyful laughter to the sea.
