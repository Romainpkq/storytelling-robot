Looking for a needle for my grandmother One evening, my grandmother sat on a chair and sewed her clothes carefully. Accidentally, a needle placed by her grandmother on the needle box rolled under the chair. My grandmother asked me to look for a needle, but after searching for a long time, she didn't find it. The grandmother said, "Forget it, forget it, don't find it, I'll take another one." Suddenly, I thought there was a magnet in the pencil case. So I said to my grandmother, "Grandma, I have a way, I will find the needle." I took the magnet in my hand and looked for the missing needle. "Haha! I finally found it!" I am a smart child. I thought: I can use my knowledge to do something for adults. My grandmother asked me to look for a needle, but after searching for a long time, she didn't find it. The grandmother said, "Forget it, forget it, don't find it, I'll take another one."
