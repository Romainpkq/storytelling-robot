He said, "I retreated because of difficulties." The second person climbed to the middle of the mountain, angry Panting, looking at the dangerous high mountains above, shaking his head and saying, "It's still enough to stop!" He also retreated. Only the third person, who dared forward on the way of climbing, fell several times, all climbed up again, fearless and discouraged. Finally, he reached the top of the mountain.

It saves a lot of energy." The second person said: "Yes, so I stopped it. It's still wise to step back halfway "The man who reached the top of the mountain smiled and said," However, you can't see the infinite scenery of the peak. "
