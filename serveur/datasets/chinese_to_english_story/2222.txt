The little tadpole swims, and after a few days, its tail becomes shorter. They swam next to the lotus and saw a big frog squatting on the lotus leaf, dressed in green clothes, exposed with a white belly, and swollen with a pair of big eyes. The little tadpole swims past and calls: "Mom, Mom!" Mommy Frog looked down and smiled and said, "Good boy, you have grown into a frog, so jump up!" In a jump, he jumped on the lotus leaf.
