Wise little rabbits used to be, there was a little rabbit, smart and cute. However, the ruthless wolf is bent on killing him. One day, the wolf asked the fox to help, saying, "You pretend to be dead, I managed to cheat the little rabbit, we get some rabbit meat to eat." The fox agreed happily. The wolf came to the little rabbit's house and stood at the door and cried, "Mr. Rabbit! Mr. Rabbit!" "What's the matter?" The rabbit asked in the room. "Have you heard about the fox?" The wolf asked. The rabbit looked up at the wolf: "What's the matter with the fox?" The wolf said solemnly: "Tell you the good news, the fox is dead, it will never lie to you again." The little rabbit didn't believe it and went to the fox's house go with. He looked out the window and saw that the fox was lying on the bed with his eyes and mouth closed tightly, as if he were dead. After thinking for a while, the rabbit deliberately put his head into the window and said to himself: "I heard that the fox is dead, and his mouth is always open. I do nâ€™t think the fox is dead." When the fox heard it, he opened his mouth immediately. . The little rabbit knew that the fox was pretending to die, so he shouted, "Uncle Niu, Uncle Ma, brother Goat, brother Squirrel, guys, come on! The fox is dead, let's throw it into the river!" The fox was scared! Hurry up and fly away.
