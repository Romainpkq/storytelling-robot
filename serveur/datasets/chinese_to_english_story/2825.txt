I am a white snowflake, a small snowflake. I float lightly from the high clouds. I covered the mountains, and the mountains were covered with beautiful white sand. I covered the roof, and the roof was covered with a shimmering silver tile. I covered the cypresses, and the cedars produced a lot of cotton. I covered the bare branches, and the branches were full of pear blossoms. I covered the wheat field, and the wheat field was covered with fluffy cotton wool. I fell to the ground, and the ground was covered with white carpets, with dazzling silver flowers. I am a white and white snowflake. I float down from the high clouds.
