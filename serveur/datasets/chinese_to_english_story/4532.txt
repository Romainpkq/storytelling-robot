Small saplings, lined up, greening the motherland is busy. Walk to both sides of the road station and hold a green umbrella on the street. Walk to the wind outlet of the field station to block the sand and ensure a good harvest. When we walked to the desert and stood firm, the desert was green and green. When I walked to the barren hill and settled down, I was wearing green clothes.
