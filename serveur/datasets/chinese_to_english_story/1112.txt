There are several beautiful goldfish in the classroom. They are different in size and color. Some have black bodies and red tails, and some have gray bodies and pink tails. The yellow goldfish looks the best and drags its silvery white tail to swim in the green plants. The yellow goldfish looks the best and drags its silvery white tail to swim in the green plants.
