I helped my mother do the dishes and had dinner. I was going to help my mother do the dishes. I put water in the pool first, poured a little detergent, and stroked it with my hands. A lot of bubbles popped out of the pool. Next, I soaked the bowl into the sink, and gently washed the inside and the outside of the bowl with a rag. Then, I washed the edges of the bowl, and finally, rinsed with water one by one. I picked up the bowl and rubbed it with my hands. The small bowl made a "creak" sound. Yeah, the bowl can sing! I also hummed the minor happily. I am very happy because I help my mother do the dishes. Next, I soaked the bowl into the sink, and gently washed the inside and the outside of the bowl with a rag.
